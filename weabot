this is nto a terminal
gnome shell is made in javascript
how can you like it
I'm testing 3D rendering through WebGL on the freebsd drm port
this shit's pretty as fuck
and your whole fucking desktop runs on javascript
the drm driver leaks memory
that's why I was at like 6G last time
I was at 1G, opened chromium and played with webGL for 10 minutes, closed chromium, 3.67G
why do you do this to yourself
first arch and now this
and you're not even using this ironically now
what's lennartwarez' current account?
just go on a random thread and scroll to the bottom
he must be in that ubuntu thread shitposting about gnome somewhere
I'm unarchiving my rootfs right now
should be done in about 5 hours
your quirks don't make the DE better though
just stop shilling it
>i like this feature
>wish i could modify it somehow
>wish i could.. CONFIGURE SOMETHING
well why can't you change it from arrow keys
because dconf editor is fucking useless
I wish openindiana was good
.yt can't say goodbye to yesterday
meh idk shit about any of the others except for lumina
but KDE is much better than gnome on every side except for your quirks which could be easily fulfilled in kwin scripts
what drag and drop
in the menu thing?
that's true on kde too though
xfce sucks in general thuogh
ooh it's much faster to extract than to create
it should be done before midday
I put my archive in the rootfs
it'll run out of space
maybe zfs will save me somehow
meh gentoo really isn't hard to install
how do you plan to use your server btw
you could cross compile on it
funpool/root   146420480 135932288  10488192  93% /mnt
there is no hope
did you listen to can't say goodbye to yesterday
listen to it its good
COME ON IT'S DONNA BURKE
.yt sins of the father
why not cwm though
./home/laurent/Documents/FreeBSD 11.vdi: Cannot write: No space left on device
I didn't even use the archive from the rootfs
how stupid am I
my command still took the one from the HDD
form the fedora partition
funpool/root   135960832 167808 135793024   1% /mnt
just removed the archive
I removed it from the rootfs
I still have a copy on my HDD
I'm doing it from there
I'm fine with qwerty
also >all vowels next to each other
that's actually stupid though
oh god please be temporary
the fuck is this
after seeing this, whatever you're doing now, as long as it's not this I approve
except if it's shilling for gnome
anyway my home dir might be corrupted :DD
permissions seem to be saved though
it should be fine
they're the exact same tbh
unity has less extensions and you can't even move the fucking dock
unless there's a gconf or whatever for that
it works here <3
we'll see once it's done extracting
it's still extracting my music dir and has the porn to go
nvm it's good now
I think it might not be done copying permissions
it's kind of weird
wait I did preserve ownership right
root is pid 0
so it's just because the permissions are empty
./home/laurent/Pictures/klogo-official-lineart_detailed-128x128.png: time stamp 2106-02-07 01:28:15 is 2803475286.772872943 s in the future
NOOO NOT MY KLOGO
it's not corrupted though
logos usually have more than one size
tar -I pxz --same-owner --warning=all -xpvf /funtoobackup/funtoo.tar.xz >/funtoobackup/command2.log
I mean it can't just change my ownership
that's the exact same command I used to archive it to
it's not even an official file
it's just some random thing in my overstuffed pictures directory
weeb yeah it's fine, it looks like it writes permission when it's done writing the directory
what do you qualify as usable
"if I can make windows move with hotkeys I can make some concessions" or "EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE PERFECT"
weeb isn't this what you want anyway http://askubuntu.com/questions/72077/how-do-i-control-window-placement-in-kde-with-keyboard
    System Settings -> Shortcuts and Gestures -> Global Keyboard Shortcuts
    KDE component: KWin ▼
    Quick Tile Window to the Left etc.
you want to move them 10 pixels or something
anyway it's almost done extracting
like it's pretty much done
in the next 10 minutes anywya
yeah it's in /usr/include right now
there's nothing after this
I am going to see if I just fucked up or not I guess
with kwin you could script it at least
but if you're going to want to use kde on wayland you should use neon devedition or some rolling release
actually kde on wayland should somehow work with your setup
you have 2 monitors right
and they're the same size
anyway this shit's done
let's see if it works now
aren't they the same size though
kwin_wayland still doesn't do multimonitor properly so idk if that'd work
anyway it seems to be working
it is absolutely working
based on slackware, supports kde
nature whites are expensive and impossible to find so I'm gonna build a clueboard with gateron yellows
what else is there
1up is expensive as fuck
just not with these fucking colours
it needs to be all black with white backlights
where do you see a 55g linear switch in there
that's still 62g though
if that's what nature whites are like it's not nature whites I'm looking for then
what just buy mx reds
if you like your keyboard maybe buy new switches for it
you could replace them no?
that's what apple uses
I also love when latestagecapitalism gets on the front page
it's very revolutionary for a short moment until the people who upvote it forget all about it because they've got the attention span of a fish
people on this sub actually want humanity to die
we wouldn't need population decline if we were any fucking efficient

I need to change that
how do I change this
I mean it's GNU uname
time to build my own uname
it might be because of glibc actually
why do you need 4.11
just to piss off people like you <3
back to the drawing board
oh it's in config.h

I'm going to patch it in the portage tree
thought you liked nm
clueboard will turn out expensive though
I'm thinking about actually wiring it myself like tuxfuk did to save money
he's in his freshman year in ee
you just need basic understanding of circuitry to do that shit
and a 20$ keyboard controller that does it all for you
if you want i3 go for sway tbh
I want gateron yellow
cheaper and apparently they're better than the cherry mx, but that might just be some anti-cherry circlejerk that I'm not aware of
gateron is lighter than black
that's a good thing
why fedora 26 tho
even their website is shit
guessing nightlight is their answer to >no redshift on wayland
even though that's false
I think opensuse is better but fedora is okaty
opensuse's install is just messier
well not the results but the installer
I know it looks exactly like flux
I bet t he gnome devs are using macOS for "research"
it looks like a shitty version of flux
look at how fucking convoluted it is
how is this enhanced
guess that's the right word
stop covering the whole fucking screen of an OK/cancel prompt
too many things in that shitty menu

kde is much better than this
we've argued this before

they had a dock before windows XP came out
that shit came from fucking nextstep
doesn't surprise me at all
> We disagree at the fundamental level. It is no use my trying to convince you about details of the GPL given that you reject its purpose.
I did not bring this up to try and convince you, or for you to convince me. I'm glad that we both understand that from the first step, our personal goals in the software that we make or contribute to are very different, so arguing about this would be a waste of energy. I simply wanted to give you some context on my position.
> Do you apply the same criticism to Creative Commons licenses and to the MPL? They too can be upgraded by a single organization.
I do, I believe that they're flawed in the same way. I believe that a truly free program should allow the user to decide not only what they want to do with it, but exactly how they want to distribute it and who they would like to associate with for this distribution, and licences that go against this are flawed and in some way needlessly restrict the user's freedom. This is in the roots of my disagreement with copyleft, but I believe that if the point of 
copyleft is to prevent the growth of proprietary software from the free software movement, it should sprout from that a new environment in which users are not restricted. It should, put simply, create a barrier between the proprietary world and the free world, and let users do as they please in that free world. You cannot, however, talk about freedom while restricting people to a single organization, no matter who you are or what your cause is. That's my 
> I wish I could write an eternal definition of copyleft, or even free software,but I tried and I was unable to do it. We don't know what issues will arise in the future.
I'm glad to hear that you have tried it. So you have seen this as a problem before? Maybe you could make the definition broader and offer a more permissive copyleft licence that would use that definition.
I personally would make this licence only able to be re-licensed to other 2-way compatible licences that share a similar clause (so they also must be 2-way compatible licences). By 2-way, I mean that I can turn licence A into licence B, and licence B into licence A as I please. Only that part would leave out all proprietary software, short-ended copyleft licences and those that can be made proprietary, and it would leave more freedom on the details of 
> I can only say that it is silly not to trust the FSF to stay loyal toits principles. If you can't trust us, who can you trust?
I try to trust only the people or the communities that I know and contribute to personally. I believe that this is normal human behaviour and I'm comfortable with it. I'm therefore naturally skeptical of those who I don't know, those that are too big to be really known and those that make it very difficult for me to really know them.
Besides, I think it's hard to argue that the FSF is very ideological. Only this is, in my opinion, something very scary about it, especially when its goal is to gain power (whatever that power is to be used for and however good its cause is). This can be applied to anything else.
I might have diverged from the GPL itself and proposed a new licence because it is a big change, but please consider this for the GPL. Free Software started as a community movement, and there is no reason for it to be legally limited to a single community's decisions. If someone wants to associate with the FSF, they would be free to do so, just as they should be free not to, and freedom is what we're striving for.

I never pretended it would be
you could make it pretty damn light though if you turn off a bunch of shit
system settings->startup and shutdown->background services
you could use something else instead of kwin, or just switch to xrender
oh that thing, just right click on your desktop, configure desktop, tweak
and uncheck show the desktop toolbox
everything that you might want to turn off is in the background services menu
and KDE Neon relies heavily on it
it basically starts nothing with systemd
what's wrong with it
right click, digital clock settings
anyhow just use fuzzy clock like a real man
click on that thing at the bottom right, add widget
then get new widget, and search for a better clock in that menu

welcome to my channel
you're right I'm sorry
I want to do void on illumos but I need a good OS to make it on
nautilus doesn't have functionality
stop doing this to yourself
you're using an unusable DE that just pretends to be usable
it's literally only a UI for the icons
the only use for it is literally just searching and navigating directories
and you can do that easily on the command line
you've been struggling with them for the past few hours with your dependency issues
dolphin has ftp, git, icons, directory/filesystem informations, terminal support that's perfectly synchronized with the file management part
DON'T YOU SAY IT
>switch kwin for compiz
but you'd use a decent DE
goddamn I wish I liked gnome though
I just don't understand how you can like it
should I just buy this https://www.amazon.ca/Mini-Quiet-Matias-Click-Mechanical/dp/B00D3BTMRU/ref=s9u_simh_gw_i1?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00D3BTMRU&pd_rd_r=G91NJQAHJPFH9ZRCEK91&pd_rd_w=YE7M6&pd_rd_wg=rhDga&pf_rd_m=A3DWYIK6Y9EEQB&pf_rd_s=&pf_rd_r=CA8MKF47X70P7RRE9320&pf_rd_t=36701&pf_rd_p=b06971ce-9992-44c1-9ee0-eb9792e71b5e&pf_rd_i=desktop
I feel like building it myself would be better but it'd also be more work and more expensive
for the keyboard I'm willing to go up to 200$
but it has to be perfect
I also could just buy a cheap keyboard and change the switches
I fucking told you
also that's like 300 CAD
I don't give a fuck about your japanese rubber switches
https://www.amazon.ca/TOMOKO-Mechanical-Keyboard-Water-resistant-Anti-ghosting why don't I just buy this and change the switches
why don't I just change the switches on my das before doing all this bullshit
I mean I could try opening up my das to see how it is
is it really that easy
I could just take a fucking butter knife, shove it under the switches and replace them
I can buy new keycaps though
gateron is fully compatible with cherry mx right
so I need 140 switches to fully replace it
still better than a whole new keyboard
maybe I could just not replace the numpad
why would I pay 40$ for blank keycaps
wait are full keyboards really 108 keys
do I have to count again
I'm bad at counting
that's something like 120 switches I'm guessing
for the keys that need more than 1 switch
I was looking at this
I wonder if I could modify my das to be backlit too
I mean if I'm gonna build my own keyboard why not try to modify the one I have first
that's the thing though
the switches are what I want to replace
so I have to replace my keycaps too just because they're not compatible with gaterons
I thought that's what you just told me
fuck it I'll just open my keyboard and see what's going on in there
and I'll get the rest from mechanicalkeyboards.com
because amazon doesn't have what I need
the switches and keycaps
now let's see how many thousands of dollars I'll have to pay in shipping and whether some of these are from zhong guo
they're all from a different retailer
get it May 4-26
 get it May 18-June 14
what the fuck how can it even be that long
there's a bunch of cat hair in this keyboard
my cat's been dead for years
pretty sure I washed it at least a few times after he died though

the only useful shit that gonzobot did is blocked in #lmr
that's not possible on #lmr
should i buy a matias or were you memeing
maybe I should just buy one of these laser keyboard that just project the keys on the table and you type by touching them and apparently they're horribhle
MAKES NO NOISE AT ALL
apple keyboards are just 60% non-mechanical keyboards?
I mean if I like trackpads I HAVE to like trackballs right?
they're relatively similar to trackpads right?
those thumb balls look awkward af tho
anyway I gotta go
I should be getting my trackball in the next hour
but I won't try it right away I'll nap first
I must resist filtering it
well the comments are okay
the top one at least
weeb why not just use your own kernel
my kernel works fine on fedora
just don't mount the efi partition and you're good
..yeah? just enable/patch it yourself
it's not like you're avoiding patches
can't you download fedora's patchset?/
I wish that fucking purolator guy would arrive already so that I can finally take my nap
then use a fucking source distro and get on with it
make a cross-compiling setup or something idk
download your updates in binary form from your local network
basically just rsync /var/portage and run install
well an install script
now that's an okay sub
but the comments are shit
why can't there be a middle
r/collapse is fucking insane
if I went to bed right now and just started to fall asleep he'd decide to skip whole alleys to get my house before
it's sad that it gets like 5 posts a month
I don't watch anime though
anyway if it had anymore those posts would just be /r/socialism and /r/fullcommunism shit
and that'd just ruin it
I mean what the fuck is up with their "kill all cops" memes
"hi I'm attacking other workers just because of who they work but I'll definitely defend these workers no matter who they work :^)"
I can't even say stupid in /r/socialism
they'll remove your comment
I mean I agree that you have to enforce against frozen peaches in leftist subs just to get around the bunch of far right raids that you'll get but what the fuck is wrong with them
they forgot about trains
I actually wonder if trains are more efficient than bicycles pollution-wise
I mean bicycles has you produce more CO2 while electric trains that run on electricity made by renewable, less polluting sources pretty much don't produce anything at all
except for the parts but I'd assume the parts are comparable for the amount of passengers
trains are more efficient in every way than pretty much anything else over long distances though
what the fuck apparently they tried to deliver it
they rang the wrong fucking bell probably because the paper's on the door and I didn't move
what's wrong with them
so I'll get it monday probably
fuck I'll actually have to go pick it up myself
that's some bullshit I was here
I didn't fucking move
oh ok it's only 1h13 by fucking bus
whatever I'm taking a fucking nap
then I'll call these assholes
if I weren't so tired I would be very upset
now I'm just very annoyed
it won't load
im gonna get my trackball this afternoon
I'll have to ride on a bus for 2 hours
there's not even a train going there
stop interupting my train shitposting
basically we have a railroad going through the city but it's abandoned
I just tried to do cmd+shift+4 on not-macOS
going through the city
why do you do this to yourself
i wish there were good linear switches that wouldn't cost me 200$ for the whole keyboard
or potentially ruin the keyboard that I have now
no reds are shit
I mean I have the money I just don't want to spend it all
I'm stuck with mx browns I guess
at least they're not blues
who started the duckhunt
I need gnu make to install s6
oh you thought I was doing it on funtoo?
I'll just keep gnu make for compatibility but move it to gmake
eh I'll use bmake where I can
make-4.2.1_3: file `/usr/bin/make' SHA256 mismatch, preserving file
xbps might not be much of an issue after all
this did not work
this is very bad
what kind of init system passes --arguments to pkill
nvm it's the void runit scripts I guess
where the fuck does it create the supervise files
and where's the actual runit source
I'll get it eventually
at least a year ago wasn't it?
we're trying to start a bsdmasterrace, literally
the bsd users rule the linux users but you're all welcome as long as you don't talk shit
there you go weeb
wait who put that there
we have a netbsd dev that comes to #lmr once in a while, she says that illumos is surprisingly similar to netbsd in some ways
I've tried it and I kind of like it, I prefer freebsd though
illumos/solaris community are too corporate I feel
it's mostly server/enterprise shit
meh, the only viable desktop distro is openindiana and it's basically the trueos of illumos
ships with pulseaudio, gnome, dbus, gnu coreutils and all that
yeah but as a user I'd rather avoid that
OSS/sndio are good enough thank you :)
colour schemes exist and are great
well nothing ships with a dark theme by default for some stupid reason
windows 10  doesn't either does it
I knew it had a dark theme but I didn't know it was default
but then again nothing follows the fucking windows theme
windows shit is like if wayland CSD had cancer
kwin will make wayland good
not really it just hasn't been well implemented
who gives a fuck about wine
no please stop with the X
we need something smaller that can produce rootless clients
and especially more stable and secure
if that was implemented in X by default as a core part of the display server sure
I don't want to sandbox
I want a proper display server that removes the need to sandbox
as usable as whichever shitty compositor uses it
yeah but they want to turn it into something where you can use any X11 window manager on wayland or somehing
as far as I know anyway
they're pretending that they just use i3 as  deafult
but it's MIT licensed isn't it
I really hope a BSD just forks it and builds something nice on it
X11 has its own bsd-like license no?
yeah people are getting sick of freedesktopware I think
it's either you install gentoo or you use a bsd and most people don't want to compile everything
that's what I'm saying
the bsds have buildservers, gentoo doesn't
I think it's laziness, it'd be very easy to implement as a mixup like the bsds are doing
anyway I need drm-next on freebsd to hit a stable point before I can fully switch to it :/
I actively follow it on github
I check it at least twice a week
I want to get into kernel hacking so that I can help them
but idk where to start
most of the work they're doing is building an interface between the linux drm code and the freebsd kernel
as far as I know
the drivers use drm
the main target is drm in order to be able to fully port drivers that rely on drm
which will be decently easy once drm is figured out
the more I listen to rms the more I realise how much of a manchild he is
There is a campaign to spread distrust for the FSF. It resembles
the campaign to spread denial of global heating.
he actually said this
and he's linking that to people who don't like an organization led by people who are batshit insane
also his whole GNU/linux argument is the most childish shit I've ever seen a man of power do
he failed to do something but he's just clinging to it so hard
I'm sorry but I use heirloom/musl/runit/linux thank you very much
I don't actually I destroyed the zpool
freebsd HAS replaced gnu coreutils haven't they?
I can't wait for them to fully get rid of gcc
only kgdb left to replace
yeah lldb is there
I'm talking about kgdb

Here is one, the code isn't bloated and doesn't mostly suck.  I find it
unethical to recommend a steaming pile of crap to someone.
that's marco peereboom though
what I showed you earlier was from an email directed to me
I emailed RMS about concerns I had that the GPL seems to be designed to give the FSF monopoly of free software, giving arguments and ideas to fix the issue, all he responded to was towards my distrust for the FSF
he's in a bubble and he was somehow given power
RMS wrote, why in his personal opinion, he does not recommend the use of
OpenBSD. And some p*** at him. What a shame ! 'Freedom' is not only
one's choice of software, but also one's choice of an own opinion.
It would serve this list and the people on it well, to allow RMS to voice
his own opinion. And, if in personal disagreement, argue. Like some
actually did in here.
>you guys should just learn to let RMS trash talk and make false claims about your OS like come on!
and he really needs other FSF sheep to defend him? he doesn't do it himself
Maybe that is true, but it's not the issue I'm talking about.  I'm not
a supporter of open source anyway; I fight for free software.
free software is whatever rms agrees with
    Why don't you ask Theo, whom you once praised, about OpenBSD?
Because he tends to be unfriendly.
why haven't I read this thread before
he's been doing this for 30 years
he's never going to change
I haven't but I'm very curious about it now
one recent issue is about qtwebengine where a bunch of FSF sheep went on a bandwagon against qt just because of a misinterpreted quote from qt's wiki
rms was in that band wagon
I'll read this after I'm done with the openbsd one
oh there's theo finally
Richard -- you spoke out of line.  You are wrong.
I feel like that's just a dad scolding his son
I am very disappointed in you Richard, calling my operating system non-free!
go to your room!
theo should've replied "at least *I* have an operating system!"
I gave up on the duck
shit's funny as hell
Richard, you are wrong.  You said very clearly in your interview that
the ports tree contains non-free software.  It does not.  It is just a
scaffold of Makefiles containing URLs, and an occasional patch here or
You are just plain wrong.  And you are not enough of a man to admit
that you are wrong.
I may be unfriendly at times, but you are a power-misusing
hypocritical liar who attacks projects that try harder than any
others to only make free software available.
But once again, you failed to educate yourself before you opened your
big fat mouth on a talk show and stated utterly uneducated and false
statements .  You have had ample opportunity to say "I was wrong", yet
you have not done so yet.
You keep argueing, and that is because you are a coward.
We don't care about your failures, Richard.
Get of our mailing lists, or we WILL start cc'ing your groups'

    Come oh dilbert of gnu, stamp your licence upon all who code. Propegate your
    gnu legacy through the universe down to the plank scale. Install your agenda
    near and far. Come and spread the evangalistic word. 
All I can do personally is bless your computer.  But if it has
non-free software installed, it needs an exorcism.
freedom is actually not being able to have all the choices
we're all from linuxmasterrace though
In addition, I thought that OpenSolaris was just a kernel, but it
looks like the question had in mind a whole system.  This
miscommunication has the effect of making my statement appear to be an
endorsement of a system.
DO SOME FUCKING RESEARCH YOU IDIOT
I prefer paste.kde.org
you don't have to create an account for kde paste
wait you do now?
whatever I made a kde identity
kde updated their website
Neither Windows nor MacOS was intended
to push major GNU packages out of use.  What I see here appears
possibly to be exactly that.  Whether that is the case is what I want
waaaaaaaaaaah llvm makes my compiler uselessssss
as you can understand I've moved on to the next
But I want to see what's going on here rather than assume.
so when the eyes are turned to him he actually wants to do research before speaking?
I've been mainly using clang where I can for a while
they've been updating gcc a lot just to have it compete because clang brought so many advantages that gcc didn't have
like readable compiler output
the output is so much more readable
and the syntax makes more sense imo
not this I guess
yeah it's pretty dead
I'd rather have a demon with dragon wings
that looks like a weird mix between a horse and a bison
free software is only what stallman likes
not that I've heard of
I'm sure if rms uses porn he either sends an email to a server that collects porn pictures from the internet and receives them in a batch or he just goes to the video store
as long as I don't use EGL drm on freebsd is alright though drakonis_
it's annoying though, I have to stay on git for it to be compatible with my hardware
stop calling it gnu/linux tigerfixes
gnu has no part in the linux operating system
according to the definition of an operating system, gnu is not a part of it
GNU is still not a part of the operating system
GNU is a part of the userspace
it's not about being an essential or not
the definition of an operating system is the software that stands between the hardware and the userspace
on linux that's the kernel, the kernel modules and the firmware
and GNU are absolutely unrelated to it
GNU use the linux kernel to operate
why do you let rms dictate how you should speak
the only reason he wants us to call it GNU/Linux is that Linux destroyed his dream of a GNU operating system
because he couldn't do it
to be fair mach is pretty damn good
and at the time BSD was too risky
because AT&T TRIED to fuck BSD in the ass
I read somewhere that he did consider using the bsd kernel
and it sucks just like every other gnu project
what's the point of using freebsd if you're going to use sysvinit, glibc and coreutils with it
isn't it just bsdified sysvinit though?
arch is horrible though
plus portage is made for linux
navigate to your package's folder, type make install clean, wait a bit, select your build options when it asks you, and it's done
but they have a buildserver
so you can just do pkg install ${pkgname}
I don't like them because they use pulseaudio by default and only support lumina
which isn't very good yet
kde isn't in the trueos repositories anymore
it's in the port tree though
it was removed last I checked
shit works on a sega dreamcast
.yt netbsd on dreamcast
pkgsrc is so good
the exact opposite of linux
you want to use this? well sorry it's only made for my specific DISTRIBUTION
not the libc, not the kernel, not the unix utilities, THE DISTRIBUTION
then you want to use another thing, it's specific for gnu coreutils, another thing is specific to glibc, then you get freedesktopware specific to the linux kernel
systemd only makes it specific to linux instead of only distributions
systemd relies on linux
you can't use it on anything else
anyway I'm starting to feel the freebsd drm-next memory leak
freedesktop don't care about not-linux
that's not because of gpl though
that's because it's abandoned
there's no point in developing it anymore either
I'm not getting mine until at least monday because of easter
I'll get it by tuesday for sure
it's so fucking warm
I miss winter already and we've got about 8 months to go till next winter
where are you from
I should move up north during summer
like go volunteer somewhere just so that I don't have to go through summer here
we have at least a meter of snow built up every winter
in places where you don't remove the snow
basically just stallman seeing llvm as a war because it makes his compiler obsolete?
that's what you get when you put your trust into an organization that's purely ideological
The basic idea of the free software movement is that users should have freedom for all the software they use.  A proprietary program is worse than no program.  A proprietary program is an injustice.
and then he goes on to say.......
either release your modified version as source in the same way, or keep it private, but do not distribute it in a way that would separate people from their freedom.
how is that freedom
>we don't care if it's free or not, you shouldn't be free to redistribute it however you want
you just need to port the vga_switcheroo code and it should work
what the hell it's only 15 degrees
why do I feel like it's 25
it supports gnome, is rpm, packages chromium properly, is redhat-like and is a good distor
literally your dream distor
it's better than ubuntu's imo
in fact how does it suck at all
you get tumbleweed for a testing release, or you get leap for something like ubuntu
leap is updated twice a year just like ubuntu I think
wait is it twice or once
still better than once every cycle of the universe like debian
no idea I've never needed them
pretty sure they have 1 click installs for most things on their wiki though
not supporting a widely-used feature because of your own standards is a huge problem though
you're just refusing to have things work on your own OS, so you'll make it harder for your OS distribution's maintainers to get it working properly
lacking PATH_MAX is an issue, and POSIX is wrong if it breaks compatibility
POSIX should be shaped to encourage compatibility, this is its purpose, it shouldn't defend one's standards
if POSIX says this is the way it should be but nobody listens to it what's the point
if they failed to keep compatibility, they failed at their purpose
this is like the MUSL devs refusing to define a MUSL-specific preprocessor variable and making it harder for everybody to patch programs to be usable with MUSL
just because you don't agree with the practise doesn't mean people will suddenly stop doing it
if it's easier to maintain a PATH_MAX than not to, what's the point
still waiting for the warehouse to open to go get my damn trackball
they don't use readline
>hi we're gnu we just made a scheme derivative
>well fuck guess we can't use gnu
why not just use libedit
that's why you should use libedit
that's also why the damn guile console is unusable outside of emacs
no you don't understand
that's what random-nick is explaining
you can't see a clock right?
now replace KDE by guile
and the clock by readline
that's the guile interpreter
then again you can easily make a guile interpreter with the guile library, just make it use libedit I guess
especially while libedit is bsd-like licensed, is more usable than readline and is in the BSD and solaris base system
still, GNU having to avoid GNU is absurd as fuck
to the point where they'd have a much easier time just avoiding GPL
and using libedit instead
because they could relicense that to LGPL and get it working with readline-like bindings
I know about GNU scheme and Guile
elisp probably doesn't count
why isn't readline LGPL-licensed at least though
this is the stupid part about the FSF
>we'll force you to have freedom
>our definition of fredom, though
>which means more freedom to us than to you <3
was that about GNU?
I hope it was
all of this is so that end users can have their freedoms... By not being able to use readline on anything that's not GNU-licensed while readline is kind of a line-editing standard now
that's why I use libedit
libedit does vi-like editing by default and supports :commands
it's also in the base install of every BSD
only downside is it's a bit harder to implement than readline, but that also makes it easier to tune to your needs in your software
I don't really see the appeal though, not sure what the advantages of it are
just seems like an outdated freebsd to me
x86 can never go away soon enough
chromium is broken on freebsd :/
well not really broken just not very good
firefox isn't much better
I'm sure it's more compatible with freebsd
I'm on it right now though
Sat Apr 15 00:54:08 EDT 2017 
but chromium is still broken
maybe I should port it
not in the official tree it's not
===>  qt5-webengine-5.7.1_1 Port not yet finished..
IGNORE=         Port not yet finished.
no good browsers for me
I'll have to help them on that port
I'll probably have flashbacks from that one time I tried to get it working properly on void
just install opensuse instead
or compile chromium yourself
yeah you'll have to compile it
the proprietary drivers are on freebsd though
I tried opensuse with gnome
well I wanted to try it
I was looking forward to trying it but then gdm refused to start when I stopped using grub
I deleted the grub partition to use my own gummiboot shit, copied the command line options, used initramfs, all that
then gdm stopped working, only flickers the screen
so I'm double checking whether there's something I missed from the grub config that I should add
and if not I'm reformatting
even if nothing implies that there's any gnu software affiliated to their linux option they still go out of their way to call it gnu-linux
you're booting a linux kernel
not that it fucking matters since GNU has nothing to do with the actual linux operating system
anyway there's nothing I missed from grub, I guess gdm uses some grub magic or something...
it's kind of ironic that I can't start gdm with systemd/lennartware
well because of systemd/lennartware
guess I'm not trying gnome today then
isn't there a chrome build for fedora though why don't you use that
you're getting a proprietary browser anyway
but if you're fine with opera it's okay
I would be tbh if I were fine with gtk
so what distor should I try gnome on next hoping that I like it
I could go full meme and try arch
I keep trying gnome over and over again hoping that I like it because liking it would make my life so much easier
just like liking gnu
but it's not that easy
is living the dream
everything looks uniform on my setup
quassel's fucking retarded though
I should go fix konversation
you ironically became dependent on arch
that's why I use a good distor and try shit on that extra HDD that I have
I always have a home to go back to
I also have it installed on real hardware..
anyway I downgraded konversation
I'm guessing it was a version compatibility issue
between konversation and qt
yeah qtcore is 5.7 I'm guessing konversation needs 5.8
anyway it's fixed now
why aren't you installing ubuntu then
never installed ubuntu minimal and I don't see why I would
the fucking packages are so split and the names make no sense it'd be hard to track what I want
the kde devel packages make more sense on fedora though
there's actually a coherent pattern
you haven't tried to install kf5 headers on ubuntu
it's the biggest pain in the arse
It's a radical reimagining of the gnome destkop!
wait do you have dual monitors or one huge monitor?
one thing I hate about gnome is that it makes my screen feel so small
everything is so big by default
it's like they're scared that their users might have the shittiest vision in the world
the fonts, the titlebar, the buttons, etc.
even that fucking panel
it's supposed to be minimal but it's fucking huge
and that's before adding up the menubars, the different toolbars and all that some applications might have
one third of your screen becomes bars
the panel, the titlebar, the menubar, the toolbar
yes, some of them have
but it still does
so if you maximize it, you have a panel, a title bar, a menubar, and the tab bar all taking space
also qt and gtk2 often use menubars and toolbars, everything that's not gnomeware uses toolbars
that pepsi campaign is the most american thing I've ever seen
>hey there's a huge political divide in the US
>how can we capitalize on that
yeah no that looks like trash
I'm imagining with the panel on top
the inner bars aren't too bad and the UI is made in a way that vertical space isn't too important
transmission looks okay tbh
I use ktorrent though
why even argue right now
we could have unity through consumerism and diabeetus if we just ordered pepsi
seriously though don't go on /r/all today
I mean I thought I could handle it
but it's too much for me today
you know what I'm talking about right?
for once please keep clicking on anime
go full meme and use gnome boxes
will it validate any of my beliefs
they have macos 7
I'm goin on a nostalgia trip
if I can make gnome look like this
I'll definitely use it
I wish I could make KDE look like this though
I mean some of it would be easy to do
the hardest part would be to keep it consistent I think
look at the system files
I'm good on konversation
I'd actually consider it
what I would like to do however is to turn konversation into a quassel client
emacs in itself IS an integration problem
what distor should I try gnome on
I just want to like it so badly
even on gnome I'd prefer using qupzilla to chromium and all that
and I'd use konversation because I aint fuckin using polari
I can't disable history on chromium
firefox nightly doesn't make firefox less shit
idc about vi keybinds
macOS does it by default
yeah the redshift thing
why would you want redshift controlled by brightness
I disabled that feature on macOS too
I went on /r/all without thinking about it
I'm gonna try fedora 26 I guess
just because the releases coincided
I'm not sure what I want from gnome though
I guess I'm thinking "well it's more supported and it's designed to be macOS-like right?" but then reality hits me in the face
and everything looks like shit on it and it's more android-like than macOS-like
but I'm gonna get a brand new trackball tomorrow why would I avoid using it :(
plus I don't want to have to reach for my arrow keys all the time
I'm probably going to have to change my workflow a bit because of the trackball
I mean the right mouse button seems to be much more awkward to use than on a regular mouse
we'll see when I get there, I'll just have to keep in mind that I'll have to change a few things
oh god why did you make me buy that
no hotkeys for hotkeys for hotkeys right?
you made a mistake
that's just a kensington ad though
well I have fedora
I'll see you on polari
I have made a mistake
the light theme is even worse than the dark theme
at least opensuse ships tweak tool by default
I do like that redshift  thing
basically a worse version of flux but it's okay
the default wallpaper on 26 is really really nice
now before I do anything let me see if I can disable THE FUCKING BEEPS
.yt NOT THE BEES
oh shit I can make it a dog
okay now I'm good
now I need sloppy focus
opensuse has tweak tool listen in the settings menu
I wish opensuse worked :(
>overlay a tasteful logo on the background to enhance user experience
>throw our brand name everywhere we can
I can't reduce scaling factor below 0.91
I already feel better
why would I not want to do that
btw there's no focus mode in tweak tool
polari doesn't use readline
what is wrong with these devs
whatever I'm going to install it and see later gnome won't let me do anything else for some reason
I mean tweak tool
everytime I change a settings it refuses or something
no this is a live iso
does it add /boot/efi to sda1
and doesn't let me change it
I want it to be in sda2 because I'll delete it right after the installation
WHY DO YOU NEED A SEPARATE /BOOT PARTITIONS
whatever I'll delete it after the installation.. I guess..
so there are these icons in the fedora installer's new partition maker
and there is absolutely no way to know what they do
they don't show text or anything useful
they just be icons
feeling good about this hostname if u know what im sayin boi
this piece of shit actually mounts its shit to /mnt
I have to start all over again because I mounted a partition to /mnt while it was doing the installation to work on my boot loader
and it uses /mnt
I  guess I have to reboot the damn live os
the installer crashed a second time because it's made in pygtk for some stupid reason
why are you pinging at me on autocomplete
alright let's try for real this time
what's my part message
guess what client I'm on
it starts with a p and it ends in trash
anyway I figured out how to use alt instead of sup to move and resize
how do you make the huge bars smaller
don't updates override that
why do you do this to yourself
no it's a desktop environment
that reads a fucking css file before drawing its title bars
that you had to edit
it's a javascript desktop environment reading css files
I could on kde too
the sloppy focus isn't working
hopefully it will after a restart
did I just fucking reconnect
I'm starting to miss kde really badly
maybe I should use smaller fonts
I'll do this after the restart though
I'm on fedora  26
for now I just reduced every font to either 9 or 10
that's the plan after the update's done
because I don't like having to install a plugin for no reason
Failed to synchronize cache for repo 'rpmfusion-free-updates-testing', disabling.
which one did you use
RPM Fusion nonfree for Fedora Branched and what will become Fedora 26 
still doesn't work because it thinks that's the old one
I'm trying fedora 26
why did I do this
the repos are there
it's not about the stability of it either
anyway I guess no non-free repos for me
I've had quite enough already though I'm going on freebsd and I'll wipe the partitions
that's the issue
Failed to synchronize cache for repo 'rpmfusion-free-updates-testing', disabling.
actually that's just updates testing
maybe I have some rpmfusion repos
I am probably going to wipe the drive in the next 30 minutes though
I'm getting a bit sick of it and it's always satisfying enough
have you seen my hostname
you have to call this operating system by its proper name
oh well I think it might be time for a reboot
sloppy focus doesn't work
https://u.teknik.io/cQRVx.png goddamn those are some good fonts
you could try it in a vm and see for yourself I guess
anyway this is fucking horrible I don't know why I even tried it I'm going back to freebsd
what does it do exactly?
don't you love being pinged by selinux through gnome's horrible notification system everytime systemd's in conflict with itself
I guess I only have to read the intro to understand it
 In an out-of-memory situation, the last resort of the kernel is to rampage and kill arbitrary processes.
this is surprisingly grim
I mean the way he said it
I still don't know how it implements it and how it's related to linux though
I'm hoping I'll figure it out in 1.1
but they're actively working on linux code?
or are they just trying to clone it as a microkernel while keeping everything as compatible as possible?
I wonder how compatible it is with the modern linux userspace
so genode is a concept and L4 is its application?
or l4 is completely unrelated
 It is a para-virtualized Linux kernel running on top of a hypervisor, completely without privileges.
I wonder how well it works and why I've never heard about it
because hurd shed a bad light towards microkernels?
yeah I understand the concept
apple used mach before darwin
I guess that's as big as it gets
I don't see a new kernel getting very big though unless google does it
is fuschia or whatever a microkernel?
they're basically the same colour
but I guess according to gnu we're going to have to call it the Fuscia/Magenta operating system aren't we
oh so magenta IS a microkernel?
I didn't know that
thought it was monolithic
well if anything this will be your big breakthrough
thankfully license is MIT-style
yeah linux is not sustainable
the more it grows the harder it is to maintain and the quicker it'll die
I don't think I'd switch to a microkernel if at least one BSD doesn't make the switch though
yeah the BSDs value quality over quantity
openbsd don't care about anything but their goals
if their goals involve turning it into a microkernel they'll do it
next step is to clean up the monolithic shitshow in the userspace
meanwhile I just wish quartz was open source
why do you make the best shit
link it please? I'll save it and read it later
have you watched it
we're tlaking about this in lmr pls come memepost https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/5644
we need you now more than ever
oh wait does ubuntu actually do zfs?
oh that's normal then
especially after the initial install
that pic isn't from ubuntu?
so what are you on now
anyway I'm in for about 2h30 of bus rides to go get my trackball
I have it
this is very strange
I'll get used to it maybe
I do like the looks of it better than my mouse and this is all that counts <3
now how do I increase sensitivity
idk if there's a gmail.com hotkey but it randomly appeared in the text box as I was fiddling with it
did you settle with fedora
I do like it better I think
but the ball kind of bounces out of place sometimes
could you send me that link on the trackball
that you sent me to convince me to buy this
well that it'd work on linux
I just want it to be faster
do I really have to make an xinput script? can't I just configure it in firmware?
eh we'll see if I can stick to it
I mean I can always refund it
how do I ban a word
man #funtoo has the weirdest people
I mean it's populated by nutjobs
I mean real nutjobs who ramble a lot and randomly talk about nukes and WW3 without making any sense
there are at least 4 people that fit this description on #funtoo
that I know of
they also randomly ping you for no reason saying something that doesn't make any sense
imagine medfly on really hard drugs
I had a shitty g502 meme mouse but at least I could configure the firmware
what about that shitty windows program, will it make the change constant?
I mean this just feels like a 20$ logitech mouse with a hugely different design
it's pretty much what it is too I guess
but every part of it feels like a 20$ logitech mouse, the kind that you use at school
if your school's on a budget
and isn't affiliated with apple <3
doesn't look much better though
I don't mean in what it looks like I mean how it feels
I guess, but I'm using it on 3500 pixels wide
and I'm always switching between left and right
you're saying that I have to turn the ball 3 times to go through the screen because my ball is big?
wouldn't that be the opposite?
but that's what I want to fix
BUT I CAN'T DO THAT IN FIRMWARE
that's the big issue
but I hate dragging config files you said I wouldn't have to
why did I buy this
anyway I need to find out which use flag I should enable to get libinput configuration
that's why I like my shit to be configured in the firmware
I should hack it
other than that it'd be great
anyway I'm watching this https://youtu.be/S0y0oXU8YNk
he start by saying that richard stallman is such an egocentrical asshole that it's impossible to get somewhere with him so you just have to let him ramble
he says it in a nice way but he does say this
I do like the mouse though and I don't blame you for kensington's disgusting software decisions
sorry if I rambled enough to make it seem that way
well for buying this
nah I just need to find the right package to configure libinput with kde
I'd use evdev if I ever use not-kde
for now I don't need it and I'd rather just change kde settings than carry xorg.conf files
plus X11 will be deprecated after plasma 5.12 releases
why would i depend on it
this guy worked so hard for his icons
I found this and I thought it was cute
he worked really hard on his icons for about a week then he made a post about it on their bloog
maybe I could design my own trackball
but it's huge for no reason
it works better on windows tbh
I hate how loud the clicks are though :/
anyway if it passes the space station 13 test I'm keeping it
the ball gives me something to play with while waiting or watching things though
I'm enjoying it more and more
I just hope the click get less loud as it gets older
you might've been kidding but i'm trying it
and the mouse was very clunky
probably because of wayland
hurr durr alpha i know
gnome still should be decently stable shouldn't it
or is it on git
neon devedition never segfaulted on me
I mean it crashed a lot on wayland but not by segfaults
anyway I figured out that I don't have to fully control the mouse all the way, just have to give it swings
apparently plasma 5 doesn't support libinput for mouse config
ye I'm installing it
this is much better
nah idk how I want them
I think I'll swap top left and bottom right though
this is good now
gonzo where are you
if any of you's in stantsia vostok you're welcome
I like my trackball
I take out the ball quite often to play with it though
like I play with it, put it in, use it as a mouse, then take it back
to not break it?
I feel like eating tacos today
give me a good bean taco recipe
i don't have it
I do think I want to install a stable fedora
eh I don't use it enough for it to matter
maybe I can just wait for it to become stable
alright I'm going on fedora
No package gnome-recipes available.
Unable to find a match
what's wrong with them
do you have gnome recipes?
oh it's called gourmet
and it's made in pygtk
should I buy vodka
beer it is then
vodka wouldn't go nicely with tacos anyway
last time I mixed vodka and spicy food my stomach hurt for two days
btw adwaita icons look fucking horrible
the only one (tm)
do flatpak applications not follow the theme
I'm looking at the american recipes
1 tbsp of sugar
they have a gluten marker
you hover over it and it says "contains gluten"
others under the american recipes are chicken noodle soup, a pizza, "tofu "egg" scramble" because tofu can be anything and potatoes
yes I saw that
everything made by erusan looks so disgusting
except for the potatoes
wait 1 stick of butter?
a whole stick of butter?
the fucking sauce on the potatoes
is butter and cream cheese with some garlic
and he puts that over only 5 potatoes
this is the most american thing I've ever seen
half of the french section is a german recipe
the other half is a cake that looks like bread
gnome recipes is actually nice though
the recipes in it on the other hand..
what's special in ff57
is the UI change on nightly?
I'll go check it out if so
so we're gonna wait for a WHILE
for firefox to become decent
while stopping support for alsa....................
so basically useless but okay
hope they still support OSS though
that'd be a big hit to the BSDs
it will never be pulled
I am very stupid
I just tried to move the cursor with my right hand while playing with the ball on the other hand
can I set the top bar to autohide
seriously  this is horrible while watching videos
oh it's okay I just set firefox to fullscreen it's better now
also that css file you shared doesn't change the size of gtkheaderbar so it's even more inconsistent
not enough t hen
how do I make weechat use vi-like editing
it doesn't use readline as far as I know
how can I set readliner
fuck this shit I'm not using any fucking plugins
fucking horrible software with horrible defaults
if it's using readline it should be easy to turn to libedit then
pretty sure it doesn't I looked into it once
I wonder if irssi uses readline
it looks like irssi does use readline
unless they just implement it
does no irc client use readline
maybe I should just make my own irc client
emacs is still horrible software
the proper way to configure an ncurses irc client should be hard-codeable using a config.h file at buildtime but changeable with environment variables which can be set in a file that the program scans by default or inherited from the shell
the only real scripted config there should be is for the UI, but even then the defaults should be sane
fuck having 100000 plugins to make something usable
there's literally no good irc client that fits with gnome
like the best option is hexchat
the two ncurses ones are fucking trash
I don't really use hexchat but it seems like the only one that would integrate well
oh right it doesn't inherit any theme does it
I'm back on polari because everything sucks but at least this integrates well
you have to use shitty software for proper integration
it uses that adwaita light theme
it doesn't even follow the dark theme
this looks like shit
I mean if you used this I'd understand why you'd think qt looks bad

from the root dir or what?
I also keep a few configs that I can't avoid
I mean you've seen them
eh I'm good with nvi
seriously though, this guy's just TRYING to avoid the main subject or giving me anything
>let me paraphrase everything you just said but keep arguing it
alright I'm done trying
I wasted like 15 minutes
this makes me anxious
this made me anxious
no wonder it looked like a third world country
https://github.com/weabot/cwm/blob/linux/TODO felt like working on this today
for the grow/shrink keeping aspect you want this to be done by keyboard or mouse?
like alt+shift+right click will do it keeping aspect or just grow/shrink the window from the corner if a hotkey is pressed?
actually I just had an idea for the mouse, shouldn't be too hard
basically the same except for the mouse I don't even have to make a new function
yeah I'll just make it a flag for the mouse resize, I'll also make a keyboard function I guess
I multiplied the window's x and y by the x / y of the mouse movement
that's definitely not gonna work I think
no I think I know
window.x / window.y = mouse.x / mouse.y
so window.x = (mouse.x * window.y) / mouse.y
I feel like that's not how it works
how do people usually do this
I mean everything's done I just have to figure out the right way to keep the aspect ration
I have a chemistry lab in 45 minutes and I haven't taken my shower yet
that code's a mess
why is literally everything in wm.c
does the mouse resize keep aspect ratio?
or is it a keyboard function
what's the name of the setting in the config file
focuswin->width = (focuswin->width / resize_keep_aspect_ratio) + 0.5 apparently
idk what the hell resize_keep_aspect_ration is, I'll have to figure it out after my shower if I have time
I have absolutely no time, but I'll think about it while manipulating strong acids and breathing in toxic metals and shit
sorry I was working on something
I called you cool
why don't we talk anymore every since I uninstalled void :(
I miss you bby
it's good if you don't have huge needs
well stable and secure
beginners shouldn't use it
the keyboard layout is just the keyboard map
it does know what you have attached
that's where you would've chosen colemak and started life anew
us is what you wanted
it's regular english qwerty
>hi I'm american I should be first on every list
I forgive you though
you're my favourite pig
void is my new best friend now
now void you'll be jealous of weeb and you'll shitpost with me all the time and weeb you'll moderate #apple and we'll only talk when I ping you
you were op before
I just demoted you to hop so that you can take weeb's place
you muse be my halfop
I have way too many ops though
why is flotwig and memebot ops again
you have a beautiful voice now
you're the only halfop here
didn't you like being a snowflake?
fix this I suck
I think I'll keep Zowlyfon as the only op who knows what he's doing
WHAT THE FUCK
you scared tuxfuk
look what you've done
it's one of those channel that gets some activity a few hours a day then it's ghost for the rest
I only wanted to keep void and you
and you have it
why isn't he voiced
anyway it's good now
I don't even remember what memebot does
maybe he forced op on himself or something?
can ircops do that?
for now he's not op anymore
maybe something we forgot about when I pinged all the ircops that one time
you're not managed by systemd are you
don't need a faulty daemon join spamming and hanging for a max of 90s before giving any response
launchd does its job and doesn't get in the way
that's miles ahead of systemd
I'm j ust memeing
just how much memory does it use for it to be too much memory
you have 4G right?
we have a new staff lurking
can/should I add it to you?
materiyolo has less than 8G
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.9.2 on Funtoo Linux 2017-02-26 powered by Linux 4.10.10, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4099 MHz, RAM: 7924/7988 MB, Storage: 0/0 GB, 633 procs, 7.99h up
I mean I have 7,9G
I want to change distors, funtoo isn't too well maintained imo
but my only alternative is gentoo unstable and that's not much better
eh not really interested in their package management system
that's what it looks like
I honestly don't care
I just want dependencies to be optional and I want qtwebengine to be (possibly) built with proprietary codecs
I also want >plasma 5.9
opensuse would be perfect if they packaged qtwebengine correctly
I don't like chrome/chromium
i only like qtwebengine browsers
the package manager should at least be flexible
I should port it to C++
or at least C
I'll try to fix it in tumbleweed again
I'll just work on it in chroot after installing it on my HDD
and if I get it to work, I'll override funtoo with the contents of that partition
kde or not qtwebengine-based browsers are the only good browsers
no, the qt package is too shit
like opensuse but worse
I'm smarter than you for that
still playing with my trackball
I'll try again on opensuse
I got it to work for a while
but then it stopped working
is it even packaged on slackware
only issue with opensuse is that it'd be hard to use my own kernel with it
I'm talking about webengine
oh that's right plasma relies on webengine now
that's why parabola hates it
broken ebuilds, outdated packages
I'm stuck on plasma desktop 5.9.2 when the latest is 5.9.4
and there's no reason for it not to be upgraded
it's a stability update
it's a stability update
I should just make my own distor
I'd have to make my own target on gentoo
they have stable which is old, unstable which is broken
funtoo has current but it's not very well maintained
why are the only good distors badly maintained
not if it's about webkit
I don't like chromium
are you memeposting again
you said that 30 minutes ago
you know you aren't going to
where can I find the crux ports tree
that's not what you have to search for
I could easily port qutebrowser/qupzilla if I needed to
webengine would be a pain in the ass
now let's see how it is
a bit old isn't it
a cold one right?
I need to sleep too
I can't find the fucking port file
I'll try it tomorrow
it's also ported to freebsd
if I can get freebsd to not segfault
or rather when freebsd stops segfaulting
it gives a good interface to a good engine
it gives potential for a good interface
to a good engine
and it's applied well
anyway I am go to sleep
freebsd's drm port were better
I would have no problem
I should help them though
I just don't know where to start
that is for tomorrow
you rigged it I'm reporting ircop abuse
dammit I just gave you ideas
I feel like I should just give up and use btrfs
but I'm so far in
I basically rewrote the whole fucking dracut module and systemd services
all that for `/sbin/zpool import -R /sysroot ${rootpool}`
that is literally all I need to execute
but no, opensuse goes nuts if I don't build systemd into its initramfs so I can't just do it through a shell script
I have to do it through a service file that doesn't listen to any environment variable whatsoever
I still have it installed
dracut documentation is absolutely fucking useless
I'm gonna have to maintain 2 initramfs
I'm doing it
I'm about to delete funtoo
after this I will be full systemd
systemd-boot, systemd initramfs, systemd init
not sure I'm on void, I'm copying everything over
it's fucking horrible but we'll see after I'm done
if it's at least usable I mean
:hal open the pod bay doors
anyway, it should take about an hour
I'm going on my laptop
.yt uptime funk suse parody
don't you love viral marketing
classical music doesn't go viral
but it doesnt support drm>4.2
it's gonna be great in a few years
just needs support on not-linux
I had to import the damn root pool manually though
it shouldn't happen next time however
what are you talking about
I'd rather a bunch of separate partitions than lvm
sound is dummy output
is this theo in the rockies?
anyway I have no more funtoo
but I made a new void in the process
my initramfs forces me to do everything manually
it thinks my host device is /dev/sda2
I forgot to edit the fstab
hold on I have something for you
you'll see what I mean
are you using it
did justjanne shill it to you
what the fuck journalctl
oh I found a clock that you might like
look for simple date and time or something like that in the widgets
it's literally gnome's clock
pulseaudio only sees dummy output
[pulseaudio] bluez5-util.c: GetManagedObjects() failed: org.freede
GetManagedObjects() failed: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. Pesktop.DBus.Error.NoReply: Did not receive a reply. Possible causes include: the remote application did not send a reply, the message bus security policy blocked the reply, the reply timeout expired, or the network connection was broken.
I'm moving to btrfs
I really don't want to though
maybe fixing the initrd will fix this
I am on the distro of my dreams now
minus the full-lennart setup
oh I get it
pretty sure qt shortcuts does support it though
they're just not global shortcuts unless you can set that up somehow
no I mean like
if you go in configure shortcuts in like konsole
it'll let you chain them
cwm itself doesn't support that either though
readline is too gnu
everything should use editline
sorry that's the new name
eh I want something that does everything I need by default
for instance, opensuse + plasma does everything I need by default except for 2 things
good qtwebengine package and zfs
and I fixed both
it has no nvi package
but I install pkgsrc on every distro I use so it doesn't matter
as in the image is out?
so what do I use
sounds like more of a hassle than freebsd
opensuse lets me uninstall the default kernel using zypper
stop making me cry
I like your typing
zypper dup reinstalls a bunch of shit
zypper up is fine though, so I guess just don't run dup ever
it's very very good
up is short for upgrade and dup is short for dist-upgrade
you wouldn't like it though because it has colours
zypper is a bit more like apt except easier to use
it has more features and it's I gues
more fun to use?
less of a pain in the ass?
zypper is pretty fast
but yeah apt is very slow
zypper is the best binary package manager imho
also zypper sourceinstall downloads the source code, the patches and the rpmbuild script to /usr/src/packages which is set up as an rpmbuild environment
so all you have to do to rebuild a package to how you want it on opensuse is modify the rpmbuild script and you're done
then you just do rpmbuild -bb script and rpm -i ../RPMS/resulting.rpm
it's really fucking cool and I wish I had known that before replacing it with funtoo that one time
when I was cursing at webengine
does dnf also do it
I know it's rpm
well zypper makes it easy as fuck
it gives you absolutely everything you need right away as you do zypper si package
it also gives you what's required to build it, development headers, compiler, make tools and all
it's much faster than dnf and apt imo
from what I've seen
I find it faster
what the fuck kind of demon is that
but -Qdtg is a bit weird
I can see yeah
just pacclean or some shit
pacman's flags are so bad
like how the fuck am I supposed to remember all of this, I'd rather just use zypper shortened-explicit-argument -flag
it's easier to remember
through speed or through wormholes?
codecs can do this?
the only good now
they made yast stop ignoring your colour scheme
opensuse is getting better and better
the one you made?
makes my head hurt
solarized light is okay
I don't like the dark one though
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.9.4 on openSUSE Tumbleweed powered by Linux 4.10.12, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4100 MHz, RAM: 4860/7972 MB, Storage: 0/0 GB, 612 procs, 2.25h up
I am very happy with this
I don't have to compile everything anymore, I get decent updates, I have qtwebengine
I mean I did have to write my own dracut module and systemd service
but it was worth it I think
it accomplished the same thing as just adding a line in the middle of a regular fucking script though
except it took about 14 hours more
that's mostly because I had to learn how dracut and systemd worked though
still works, thank god
brushed it up, removed zfs-dracut which means I had to recopy the files and all
but it's all good
and the clicks on the expert are too loud I feel bad for my housemates
I mean that they're insanely loud
like I'd actually find them annoying as fuck if I didn't have headphones
and the dt2 looks really nice too
plus I only use the trackball with one finger
I'll get it next week
cmd bash -c "while 1; echo systemd--; done"
anyway I gotta go, cya :)
Zowlyfon gonzo wasn't even here lol
you up/downvoted systemd this morning
gonzo wasn't even here
anyway time for nap

that's more like it
Startup finished in 15.281s (firmware) + 1.178s (loader) + 2.917s (kernel) + 5.100s (initrd) + 3.226s (userspace) = 27.703s
look at this shit
my uefi takes longer than the fucking OS
sounds like systemd alright
my initrd is long because it has to import a zfs pool, which takes a short while
all uefi needs to do is to get keyboard input, load EFI-marked partitions and read them
why the fuck is it taking 15 seconds and hanging every reboot
I wish systemd-biosd was a thing
because it's still be better than my shitty uefi
I looked into how much it would cost for me to buy a ryzen CPU with a new motherboard
maybe like 500/550 with tax and shipping
I'll afford it this summer hopefully
I am happy with my CPU though so I could just buy a new motherboard
but I feel like buying a new motherboard without taking the occasion to switch my CPU is a bit of a waste
I should make a website that publishes as much information about you as it can find on your browser as possible to itself
so you go there to find information about other people but your information is also on there
well, not just from your browser
there is no counter
this is the internet
I should try to contact lennart and tell him to make an open source linux-based uefi that installs automatically with systemd
bootctl install installs systemd-boot in the place of your regular uefi and provides a settings menu
or can be setup from systemctl lol

I have to wait 10 minutes now
I added some red to the ukrainian flag
redhat aren't messing around
you don't want to work for the americans
you don't really work for community distributions
you contribute to them
there might be a few guys getting paid to manage the whole thing, but they're paid very little and most of it is community effort
redhat and SUSE are companies selling products, that's why you can work for them and get paid
that's what contributing is
if you're using Linux and report a bug they'll fix it and make money from their contributors, so you worked for free for the linux foundation
you're working out of your free will and desire to make something that you like better
sure it might be work but it's something you're interested in
if you like Fedora why not?
you're interested in it and you want it to go further no matter what, plus you're not working very hard
even if you look at it from an individualist pig's perspective it's mutually beneficial
oh yeah I'm a huge capitalist definitely
> (weeb) [55/72] <weabot> HE WAS FUCKED TO DEATH BY A SEAL!
I love getting fucked in the ass by corporations and having my soul sucked out of me little by little, it's human nature
if Fedora is your favourite open source project, then why not?
that's like half a page in a minute
OH SHIT HIDE IT'S WinterBluFox
yeah, and your favourite open source distro has redhat software, when you submit bugs to them they'll patch it and move it upstream until it reaches some for-profit company or a foundation that pays people like linus 10M a year
so by using linux, reporting bugs and contributing to various things you're working for free
no matter who it's for
but you do it out of your own free will, out of passion, for something that you want to see get better
and no matter who's at the top this is what your work will contribute to
we live in a capitalist society, it's impossible to avoid, you're just working indirectly
all you're doing is avoiding being more direct
for example, if you make a program that's gcc-compatible and make it open source, someone will take that program and package it, someone might make it for clang, that someone might find a bug with clang using your gcc code that makes it not-entirely-compatible-with-gcc, they'll either fix it or submit it to the llvm team, Apple funds the llvm team and uses it mainly to compile iOS, macOS and all their software, so by making open source 
software you've just contributed to Apple
that's just how the unix ecosystem works
so by working for fedora, packaging qt5 software, finding bugs with llvm, fixing drm bugs, etc. no matter what you're doing there's a corporation that you're working for free for
no im not
every breath you take under capitalism is exploitation

GNU has no place in the Linux operatin system's name
idk I'm working on the freebsd thing

nah I'd rather compile during the day
I don't like to be bothered with flashing lights and CPU fans while trying to fall asleep

hope you didn't pay much for it
nik282000 that's fucking horrible
I really don't get why people use trackballs
yeah but you lose a lot on the accuracy don't you
and how do you move the ball, do you move it with your fingers or the palm of your hand or what
that's pretty obvious yeah
what about the ones with the big ball in the middle
> Multi-function ball lets you easily navigate through your music, pictures and documents using media or document view mode 
the guy in the picture just looks like he doesn't know what to do with it
"Okay, Bill, just pretend there's a mouse there"
I imagine using a trackball is like trying to move the mouse with the little balls in those old mice
I guess that's the basic concept
this kind of thing does look kind of useful if you like to lay back https://www.amazon.ca/2-4GHz-Handheld-Wireless-Optical-Trackball/dp/B008M4X6UW/ref=sr_1_16?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1491013254&sr=1-16&keywords=trackball
I really should find somewhere to try it first or at least find a hybrid
I don't have money to throw into a mouse that I probably won't like
it's like the little nipple mouse on the thinkpads everything swear by it I always found it horrible to use
I might be weird, I actually like trackpads
I even prefer them to a regular mouse for basic purposes
that might be because I only use apple trackpads though
how bad macbook trackpads can be or trackpads in general?
yeah I love it
the only bad things about apple products is that they're overpriced
If Apple hadn't restricted their OS to their own machines, or at least made their machines cheap enough, they would've fucked microsoft in the ass
most apple peripherals are trademarked
and copyrighted and all
but the actual hardware is just regular intel, broadcom and all
they contract companies for their internals and make the design and peripherals themselves as far as I know

I have both plasma 5 and amdgpu working on freebsd
the biggest issue I have is related to freebsd itself not supporting it in any of their releases
not even the current or unstable or git or anything
yeah I'm interested in trying it
although I'm busy getting freebsd to work
that reminds me I need to go start compiling ghc on my laptop
my laptop runs on macOS
I did install it with gentoo though
anyway macports seems to pull llvm, something tells me it might compile it with that
it's pulling a specific version of llvm
they had to compile the first one somehow
especially if you're making a non-generic kernel linux really isn't too long to compile
funtoo current is on guile 2.0.x
funtoo has its own target
they only add tested ~amd64 packages
so you get updates faster but they're more reliable than if you were on gentoo ~am64
I never compiled systemd
because you shouldn't use systemd on a distro that requires you to compile your packages
https://github.com/weabot/ed/commit/c109137cae89ecd353f49df297a1710d17fdecb0
libedit took about 20 more lines to implement than readline
what the hell lol
is op now
this is even worse than +v :(
pretty much bsd license, it has a different way of going at it too
I mostly did it because I was curious
I dislike copyleft/restrictive licenses because I think they aren't truly free though, and they're a horrible way of going about trying to make free software a thing
all it does is push the free software community to its own little dark corner
no, BSD-like licenses are truly free
all GPL is doing is forcing companies to build their own shit instead of relying on the free software/open source community
it's not stopping proprietary software
yes it's called BSD 2-clause
as a user, if I use a BSD 2-clause licensed program, I have free software, that's it, same advantage as if I had used a GPL-licensed software
they can do that with GPL too, and it would be in their best interest to contribute back so that their changes can be worked on by an open source community
give me an example
also what do you mean the BSD license doesn't give you the essential freedoms
you have the freedom to run, look at the code, modify the code, redistribute the code, redistribute modified code, etc.
how is this not the essential freedoms
yeah that's why companies like to avoid GPL, companies that could massively contribute to the open source community if they had the chance to rely on it
look at apple and LLVM
sure we don't, we just live in a capitalist world run by companies
we just live in a world where things that make money rise above things that don't
also what the fuck is going on in this channel
what the hell have you started
nope, because Apple needed LLVM to use proprietary blobs with it in XCode which wasn't possible with gcc
and without apple, LLVM really wouldn't have gotten far, LLVM is basically Apple's toy and it dripped onto the rest of the Unix community
goddamn something's taking 5.6G of ram + 1.5G of swap
anyway I have plasma 5 and amdgpu working pretty well on freebsd
that's a big win for them
freebsd has gnome 3 in the repos
what the hell can
it's one of gnome's project goals to restrict the systems it works on to systemd/linux/x64
pissing off the ops and posting ladybooys
careful there you might make libinput good
don't want to do that
or at the very least portable
it beats evdev anyway
and the millions of other X11 input drivers that you need to get everything to work
it seems to be really hard to get into freebsd upstream
I mean idk but there are working stable version of the kernel with drm updated to linux 4.7 and plasma 5 seems to be working fine when building it from the ports tree
but none of this is in upstream
in any of the releases
does it usually have binaries or libraries at a specific location or something
or do you just want me to check the repos
libudev-devd-0.2               libudev-compatible interface for devd
could the memory thing be because of zfs
or a combination of zfs and freebsd lol
I wonder how compatible macOS would be with freebsd
like I wonder if I could just throw a wrapper around macOS software, something like wine and get Aqua/Quartz/Cocoa running on freebsd
not sure about lvm, but zfs does things like this
and freebsd supports zfs
well then you should know that you can have a bunch of volumes and subvolumes on the same pool
idk about lvm with UFS though
anyway I'm gonna go on linux, enough messing around with freebsd for now :D
absorb all of the bad chemicals in your body
or whatever people at charcoal for
nah it's something people did in the early 1900 or something
I mean activated carbon does sound like a scam
like water memory or whatever these idiots believe in
this pure water remembers the molecule of medication that it's touched
that's a nice /fit/ maymay
i tried to click it just made the text blue wat do
yeah I know that's what I was saying
I just did foreach instead of for in C
malloc.c:2392: sysmalloc: Assertion `(old_top == initial_top (av) && old_size == 0) || ((unsigned long) (old_size) >= MINSIZE && prev_inuse (old_top) && ((unsigned long) old_end & (pagesize - 1)) == 0)' failed.
anyway this is always a good sign isn't it
not right now
yeah it's really easy
the installer is pretty good
no I'm on funtoo, freebsd is very unstable I don't think I'll use it as my main for a while but I'll boot it once in a while
I mean basically half of my system is running on git and the other half is the unstable release
I got plasma 5 to work though
why would you want to replace the freebsd bootloader
for some reason all of my mallocs fail
86              fbuf->lines[0] = malloc(1); why does this fail
I don't get it
why are my mallocs failing
what have I done wrong to the malloc god
maybe you could help me with this? I don't understand https://github.com/weabot/ed/commit/ec44ad164fe86794032054a3b01e9179441503e0
it fails in initbuffer and every function that it calls
also please someone ban hurrbot
did I delete its init function?
it's only temporary don't worry
I replaced readline with libedit
aren't the licenses compatible?
yeah it's BSD 2-clause
isn't "buffer fbuf;" enough to initialize it?
        char *localstring = malloc(maxstringsz);
both of these failed
gdb shows maxstringsz containing the right number too
it's 29 in my case
I'm just now initialising it though
but it can't even get past malloc
noto is usually the goto
one thing that libedit has over Readline though is that it uses vi-like keybinds by default
and they're pretty damn good
you can hardcode them but there must be a config file somewhere where you can set that
I was just curious about it
it's a bit harder to implement though
in /r/place they turned the anarcho-communist flag into anarcho-feminist
I wonder how many of these images were made/kept by bots
please don't give Jennifer-Lawrence op again
as long as it doesn't involve you being op
why is a windows user op in a linux channel
is doom on linux yet
yes but it's still better than directx
mantle is vulkan now thuogh
yeah but I don't work on wine
I don't like wine
I'd rather use windows
when I ask about doom being on linux I'm only referring to natively
the newer one
the first doom has so many open source clones
oh and it ran on linux also
dependencies are a pain in the ass on ubuntu
the packages are so split
yeah if you want to not have to do a lot of work yourself for packages void isn't for you
that's why I stopped using it
wine is only a problem
I wouldn't want to piss you off badly damn
honestly opensuse tumbleweed is better than fedora
also if you want good repos opensuse is more for you
fedora doesn't even have official proprietary repos
mainly a mix of that and the reality of the distro
the community and the devs live in 2 completely different worlds
yeah arch is very minimal just because it has no official install script lol
no split packages, optional dependencies are avoided, etc. etc.
I've been over this enough times already
ubuntu users, enterprise fedora/redhat users who have a sysadmin to support them
many people, most of them not using it at home as their main OS
it's minimal because they don't even have to try
if that's what you mean
>well I'm packaging a single kde application, I guess I need to pull in all of KF5
most kde applications only pull 5-6 KF5 packages and about 2 to 4 qt5 packages
and that's because they're all so split
doing it by hand isn't much easier than just pulling and building from git, and using yaourt or something makes it dangerously close to an actual package manager which it wasn't designed to be
I got my amdgpu card and plasma 5 to work on freebsd this morning :D
my point is that there aren't many advantages in having the AUR in the first place
yeah they're making a lot of progress, but none of it is in any release in upstream, they're all in branches or in patches to your ports directory
I usually use 4K
it doesn't really matter though
I know a lot of people use 4M
I do dd if= of= bs=4K status=progress && sync just because I like knowing that it's doing things
firefox is unusable regardless
that'll just be shoveling the dirt back in their grave though
oh god op implies voice
what even is seamonkey
I only know that 4chan thinks it sucks
does seamonkey keep up with firefox updates or is it just abandoned
does seamonkey even support html5?
it's outdated as fuck though isn't it
whatever qtwebengine is the future
I think ZFS is good but it's mostly just another reason to hate oracle
that's true though
that and the fact that they murdered and raped Sun
meh qemu is enough imo
no need for redhat-manager
your nick earlier was literally GNOMElover
pls stop calling me a liar
only because you don't have a multibillion dollar industry powered by individualism and the oil industry causing massive amounts of pollution
if the money that went into cars in the last 20 years went into making trains and public transportation better nobody would be using cars
exactly when they don't revolve around a multibillion dollar industry powered by individualism and the oil industry causing massive amounts of pollution etc. etc.
I don't like salmon though
but I love electricity
you haven't seen random_nick yesterday
yes, because these cars are very inefficient to provide proper transport
they wouldn't have to drift if they were on rails
and the amazonian forest wouldn't be cut down to make the tires they're burning
but look at the smoke though
I mean they're efficient to end our suffering faster
but I don't see how that's related to transportation
so what do you have against the amazonian forest R0flcopt3r
are you afraid of bugs
this guy's having a lot of trouble staying online isn't he
Jennifer-Lawrence is still op
please make it stop
they were a joke
I would've actually believed it though
the easier fix would be to use a decent init system
that's pretty obvious though
not without hosting your own repos
nah obviously you have to send in manually each electron in a very specific order that the compiler stacks on top of each other to create a binary
uefi or bios
idk about the mbr one, if you have more than one in the UEFI SSD look at the EFI folder in your efi partition and delete those you don't need
there should only be one instance of grub in your mbr
because that's how mbr works
that's only the spirit of stallman protecting your freedom
with this kind of art it must be bots I think
either bots or really dedicated communities
that shit would be easy as fuck to bot though
anyway I'm going to put another red pixel in the anarcho feminist flag
there are a bunch of yellow pixels on the flag but they chose to override the red one
imagine if there were no cooldowns on the pixels
For too long, the maintainers have accepted patches from *anybody*.  Criminals, drug lords, gang members, RUBYISTS. 
never seen anyone who actually uses that ever
oh wait no that's elementary
enlightenment is the budgie one right
the hell is enlightenment then
oh that's what I had in mind
well either way ExeciN I've never seen anyone here who unironically uses it and that's usually a bad sign
but then again I'd say that about netbsd if it weren't for medfly
someone should draw a voidlinux logo in the middle of it
A U.S. drug dealer
is betrayed by his best friend
that sounds like the most boring story ever
GNU has no place in Linux's operating system's name
tux isn't even a good mascot
konqi and the BSD beastie are better
the chameleon is nice too though
you can easily change that though
what do you mean Plasma's panel isn't big
I mean I guess he wants it to look like windows 7 or something
that's usually how big I keep it too
anyway brb I think something crashed because of that huge panel
that usually doesn't go well
because then you'll need another dependency and another and half of your system will be on the unstable and the other half on the stable
trust me I've tried
I really miss opensuse honestly
even though I'm on a good distor now
just noticed that poker keyboard doesn't have any arrow keys
what the fuck am I supposed to do with ti
what do you mean
this is annoying though
how does programming it work
this sounds like a pain in the ass though
I just don't want to spend money :/
I said I don't want to spend money
why would I spend 80 more dollars for rubber keys
rust is the new C++
just a massive corporate language that's only purpose is to make programmers faster
I'm trying to get ktexteditor to repeat the last search if the current search is empty
I thought "well just make it use the last non-empty parameter in history if the search is empty"
sadly it's Qt, C++, KDE so it's never that simple
apparently there's some unknown force just appending the empty search even though it shouldn't
because that's my only issue with kate
ktexteditor is kate, kdevelop and kwrite's backend
ktexteditor is the text editor and kate, kwrite and kdevelop are the interface
they all use the same editor
I wonder how many dozen years before netbsd supports rust
well that was quick
rust sounds horrible as a low-level language
dammit I forgot what I was going to do
maybe in a couple years
I'm not good enough yet I think
I'll check it out
it's an online thing?
I'll check it out yeah
lol, the registration site hate this box with arrows to enter the year
I instinctively clicked the arrows, it starts at year 1
I mean the year for the date of birth
idk, maybe they wanted their own notepad
not that it's hard to maintain it's small as fuck
it's basically just a textbox and a simple menubar as an interface to ktexteditor
it has kwrite.cpp and main.cpp
of course there is
you mean all text
sed -i -e ";s/????/1950/g" file
it turned out being a preemptive april fools joke all these years
yeah, free to let the FSF decide who you can share your code with
I love linus
grub calls the windows boot loader I think
I'm not sure though
if you're on uefi systemd-boot is genuinely better
I'm saying that unironically, it's actualy what I use to manage my efi partition
it does its job well, it's relatively small and simple and it has absolutely no ties to systemd the application suite except that you have to install it through systemd
which  you can do on a live usb
yeah of course
that's the thing, you install systemd-boot in your windows EFI partition, systemd-boot will automatically detect the windows bootloader, you mount systemd-boot in /boot and install your kernels to it and make a config file for your distro
if you want to manually manage an efi partition (like you pretty much have to do with grub except for the scripts that ease the job) it's much better
you should make a bigger one then
and copy the windows files to it
it's what I do
they just call it systemd-boot for some reason
otherwise it's entirely separated from systemd
sure, it probably would make it a bit faster
i definitely would work
but it probably wouldn't make a noticeable difference
well I guess that would mean you kernel/boot partition is on ssd
so yeah it would make a difference actually lol
that would probably be enough for one kernel, I'd go 1G to be sure
you isolate the caffeine, boil it with baking soda and smoke it
you don't feel like you're making real drugs if you don't do the chemistry yourself
you made an efi partition formated as vfat, mounted it on /boot, installed a kernel to it and copied the shit in the windows efi partition to that one?
that might be your issue then
another reason to switch to systemd-boot
the opensuse live CD doesn't use systemd does it
I thought it was running on some sysvnit-based init
or just go full gnome meme and use that one gnome irc client
goddamn polari looks like shit
is that what you're trying
how can you do this
well I have QString.readline()
at least it's not GNU
you're addicted to GNU software can't you see
this is a plague
they also have libedit by default though https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/src/lib/libedit/
there aren't many reasons to use it
just stick to mesa it's good enough
performance is comparable on most cards except for the RX 4xx
that's why I removed readline from my very incomplete text editor
go into detail I can't get shit from what you're giving me
you have no boot options anymore or what
well Zawaken[mobile] Misero you can cry together at least
I'd just boot the iso, chroot into the install and try to setup an esp myself if I were you though
you don't need to reinstall the whole thing if it ended succesfully
mount your opensuse filesystem
so the root partition to /mnt, boot partition to /mnt/boot, etc.
then go in that directory, mount --rbind /sys sys, same with /dev, mount -t proc proc proc, etc.
the usual chroot stuff
then cp /etc/resolv.conf to etc/resolv.conf to keep network config although you won't need it so you can skip this
then you chroot /mnt
well you know how to chroot
where is your efi partition mounted to
piped it to /dev/null
yeah, once in chroot you do bootctl --esp=/boot/efi install
wait is it esp or path
I think it's path
sounds more like it
then you copy your kernel to /boot/efi, you can rename it to a shorter name, then you make a config file for that kernel by following the instruction on that freedesktop page
you could also take the opportunity to mount your windows esp and copy everything there to /boot/efi, still in chroot ofc 
make sure you save the logs I'm not explaining again lol
have you copied the files already
are they backed up somewhere
well.... then you're going to have to get a windows 
you can still save the linux partition
then you have no operating system..
I mean you don't have to reinstall windows, there's probably an automatic fix thing in their CD
wait why did you use the liveCD instead of the installer
yeah but the liveCD isn't recommended and is probably not very well supported
anyway im gonna mess around on freebsd brb
I'm on lumina though
still on lumina but now there's sound
YOU'RE IN CAHOOTS WITH HIM TOO?! I TRUSTED YOU
I've had it for a while
you're all in cahoots
everyone is against me
you can't trust gnome users
sure but not in haskell yet
I was going to ask what's a good book on haskell
oh materiyolo sent me a pdf of that
I'll scp it over
he's annoying as fuck
it was hurrbot
R0flcopt3r is the one who gave it to him in the first place
thanking him is like thanking hitler for shooting hitler
I've never been op
well there we go
I was op once
can I kick Jennifer-Lawrence
everyone should kick Jennifer-Lawrence at least once in their life
I feel like having a star for both pointers and multiplications in C is a bit confusing
but wouldn't that do it with multiplications too?
sizeof(char*) * newsize
how do I make this clearer
that it should be sizeof(char*) multiplied with newsize
anyway that's not even the issue that I'm worried about
actually it's not a segfault
it's invalid next size
haven't seen him talking
we have a gnu+linux thing even though gnu has no place in the operating system's name
hold on a seconf
there's a definition that mentions the userspace but that's fine too
does the GNU software fit in that
GNU is ALL userspace
not the operating system
GNU is not OS-specific
and Linux can run without GNU
then how is GNU a part of the Linux operating system if it's not exclusive to it and doesn't contribute to the operating system's tasks
you're talking about a compiler
not the operating system
and it can be compiled without GNU, there's an llvm patch
it's just very outdated
POSIX covers userspace too
it's not specific to operating systems
NT is the Windows NT kernel
so Windows is still the Operating System
POSIX defines an interface
now an operating system
also there is a difference between the technical name and the trademark name
and I don't think the linux foundation or any of the distros trademarked GNU+Linux
no, the technical name is the name of the kernel and the trademark name is the name of the distribution
the technical name is Linux and the trademark name is Red Hat
only because the GNU dictators made sure that that's what shows up in os-release
that doesn't make it true
unless you think 2 + 2 = 5
that doesn't make it true for all definitions of +
especially for the common ones
what are you saying
no, it's not
Linux can run without GNU, and GNU isn't Linux specific
therefore GNU is not a part of Linux
no, GNU is a small, replaceable part of the userspace
I agree with weeb too, udev is much more important to Linux than GNU is
then why can I run void on musl and busybox?
and if you think that Linux is small, you haven't tried making a kernel. All GNU has done for the common linux operating system is a libc and coreutils as well as a few useful libraries
Linux does not necessarily rely on GNU
GCC is a compiler
not an operating system
then Windows is MSVC/Windows and FreeBSD is Clang/FreeBSD?
gcc runs on windows
gcc is neither linux specific nor a part of the linux operating system
gcc is replaceable as well
what's this if GCC isn't replaceable then
but you're claiming that it isn't replaceable, when it is
that website is the proof
and you're defining an operating system by its compiler?
and even if GCC wasn't replaceable, I fail to understand how GCC is a part of the operating system
that would be like saying that C is a part of GNU Guile just because a C-compiled compiler compiles the Guile compiler
A compiler defines in absolutely no way an operating system
how is that related to the operating system
The operating system is Linux, and it's compiled using GCC
then we must call it GCC+Linux?
go in the netbsd mailing lists and tell them that lol
openbsd would throw a fit
however I'm calling FreeBSD llvm/FreeBSD from now on
and that's absolutely unrelated to the Linux Operating System
the Linux Operating System is the Operating System that hosts your userspace GNU Software
the same GNU Software being able to run on the BSDs, on Windows, etc.
The only GNU Operating System is HURD and it sucks
Linux is an operating system
GNU is an application suite
GNU Hurd is the GNU operating system
from GNU's perspective it's all "OPERATING SYSTEM OPERATING SYSTEM OPERATING SYSTEM"
except for things that aren't from GNU of course.
no that makes me realist
GNU is not an operating system
unless glibc communicates with my CPU somehow
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.
Yes, a kernel is an operating system
a kernel and part of the firmwares, modules, etc.
the operating system is a layer between the hardware and the software
libc is not part of that layer
libc is between the kernel and more software
so if I take GNU Hurd and port old NextStep software to it and somehow make it a libc, unix utilities, etc. this way
then it's not the GNU operating system anymore?
anyway, just going from the objective definition of an operating system tell me where GNU fits in this
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs. All computer programs, excluding firmware, require an operating system to function.
an Operating System should not carry an ideology
why the hell should it
it's a fucking operating system
the revolution is the only way we will be free
but it won't happen before we're all under a kilometer of water trapped in a bunker
and then we'll run out of air before we can even finish it anyway
are you proud of me
anyway, I have just forked all of the GNU software on my system and they're now called WEABSOFT
now my operating system is WEABSOFT+Linux
please call it it's proper name
seriously though, coming from the objective definition of an operating system GNU has no part of it
the most it does is an interface to kernel calls
if a definition is subjective our world is fucked
oh wait it already is
>I'M NOT WRONG I'M JUST SUBJECTIVELY RIGHT
>FROM MY POINT OF VIEW 2 + 2 = 5 WHY DID YOU GIVE ME 0 ON THAT EXAM
yes that is definitely what glibc
glibc handles so many calls directly to my CPU
if I believe that aids is the cure to cancer hard enough maybe it'll make it true :DDDD everything is subjective isn't it?
yeah and I'm sitting on thin air, literally flying
the meme needs to die
ideology needs to die
ideology is the reason why proprietary software exists in the first place
>gtk bullshit, no alt+right click to resize, dark themes are all broken because of CSD
also no worthwhile software fits with Gnome's theme
gtk is never okay, middle click for resize is not okay, and yes, dark themes are broken
anyway we've argued this enough
I don't like adwaita
dark themes is broken for gnome
also why would I use a gtk desktop environment when all I use is qt
the only thing that I would consider using that's not qt is the web browser but firefox is shit and is only getting worse and chromium doesn't let me disable history while enabling cookies
so qupzilla is perfect for my needs as a web browser anyway
it's not getting better
stop lying to yourself
it works here though
same with you and plasma
but that means yes if you use the classical definition
not the big bad soviets
there are a lot of leftists fighting with the YPG
yeah, they're general leftists though I don't think they have a specific ideology that they preach
which is a good thing
worst part is that Marx was against ideology in some way but he was for ideological propaganda in another way
this is something that I've never understood
you want the government to rule realistically and objectively while distributing propaganda
that is purely ideological
but yeah, I'm anarchist, weeb mostly just shitposts about global warming
global warming isn't cute either :(
why are only the bad things happening
except for china cutting coal
they don't even use the right name
I mean china cutting coal is pretty good isn't it
and the chinese/japanese/south korean railroad systems
and the european railroad system
those are good things
freebsd is getting better and better at drm support
but for steam at least they're working on it
this is not something that you should care about
it's the GNU/Freedesktop desktop environment
what do you need
you could dual boot
pretty sure I did at some point
I don't have it on this fucking partition it's on neon devedition
what I thought I had a screenshot
I have it mounted but it turns out I didn't
what's a grayscale icon theme
as much as you could grayscale gnome
icon themes aren't DE-dependent
most I can do is just remove all icons
which I CAN do
also show me what happens when you press sup
show me what happens when you have icons on your screen
do you have a black and white filter
well fuck why didn't you say so
I ran an update that broke kde so uh
I mean I'm basically running git on that distro so it's to be expected
one pixel at a time
you can setup xorg to have a greyscale filter though
and the only issues were the icons
either just make an empty icon theme or find a grayscale icon theme and you're alright
that was the only colour that I had
everything else was grey
either xorg or make a qml script, it shouldn't be hard
the way to make it is supported though, you're just the quirkiest cunt so nobody made it
it's not like KDE can't support this
and you *could* use KDE with compiz
I hate the dock randomly popping up if I get close to the bottom
I'd rather just have it there
plus if I want applications to be fullscreen I'd fuckin go fullscreen
I hate vertical docks/bars
horizontal space is much more valuable than vertical space
we read from left to right
"anime weekend sale"
i didn't know you worked at steam
there's an anime weekend sale
there's a bunch of ghost in the shell crap
I think they put their movies on steam
I'm looking for a decent sci-fi game again
it's too late
I'm getting a bunch of shitty horror games just because of that one revolutionary fake chinese horror game
what were the issues
why would I play shenzhen i/o when I have a fully programmable computer
I don't understand this
if I want to program
I just have to open a terminal and program
AW YEAH NOW THIS IS MY TYPE OF GAME http://store.steampowered.com/app/415610/?snr=1_239_1200__1251
holy fuck there's a sequel
huh, apparently illumos is just a kernel?
one of them leaves you a bit less mutilated
OpenIndiana Hipster 2016.10 Live DVD (32/64-bit x86)	
how is this possible
it's an illumos distribution apparently
illumos is its successor
it looks fairly active
there's a big jump in the illumos blog
from july 2013 to october 2016
and it's been pretty damn active since then
I mean illumos is a good idea
make a good, true unix operating system except don't split kernel development like crazy like the BSDs are doing
the BSDs are all developing on their side
and they have to port everything from one BSD to another even though they're all so similar in general design
it's a very inefficient way of going at it and imo one of the main reason why linux is ahead of them
idk if you could say linux is "only barely" ahead on desktop
you should ban weeb
yeah, why was that not a man
he wants to get banned don't give him what he wants
or he'll keep coming back
my ISP owns 75% of media outlets here
former Prime Minister of Canada Brian Mulroney serves as chair of the board
oh and its CEO ran for prime minister of quebec
not yet I'm thinking about it
I have until the 5th
> (weabot) [15/73] <weabot> ogg is bloat
I'm trying neovim-qt
yes that's why I'm trying it
I randomly saw it in void's pull request list
the package looks perfectly fine and there hasn't been an update on it for 2 months
well more like a month and a week
are you actually using edge
I see a lot of things wrong
well the image might be a bit distorted I guess in the video
just download a proper browser though
edge IS the problem
if you're going to use gnome why not just use windows
still looks better than gnome
unless command -v shows gnu
also gnutls is something completely different, you're thinking of coreutils
openindiana uses pulseaudio by default
hold on I'll check
although weeb is right pulseaudio runs on anything
even netbsd supports pulseaudi
well "supports" might not be the right word
the package manager provides
also the default shell is bash
it comes with tcsh though so I'm not complaining too much
I'll actually remove /bin/bash and see how far I can go
>hi i have to write a bunch of scripts and add plugins after a dreadful configuration menu to make my shell even remotely usable
from my experience yes
with tcsh I just need a few environment variables
yes but they're horrible documented
the default config is also fucking horrible
that's what I'm referring to when I say "I have to add a bunch of plugins to make it usable"
then you've never tried tcsh
I don't want it to parse everything like zsh
that's fucking a nnoying
it's just the right mix of enough features for little required config and not getting in your way
anything else misses it on at least one of these
zsh gets in my way and takes too much config but has a lot of features
ksh doesn't have enough features, as a result you have to manually script them but at least it doesn't get in my way
bash is a similar thing than with ksh but more painful
openindiana also uses coreutils
they're literally trying to be linux with solaris kernel
do it more often
openindiana isn't too bad
it's probably the trueOS of illumos
it uses mate though
but they all suck
gnome 1 was a shitty KDE ripoff, gnome 2 at least was a bit original but now it's outdated and gnome 3 is a mix between android and macOS
and a shitty one at that
alright now I'm triggered
as for virt-manager I just have a generic script to keep for my QEMU vms that I just copy over
and I have a script to setup my virtual disk
literally no need for virt-manager
default Gnome applications suck
at least safari is decent
there's a command line for a reason
>hi im weeb i hate mouse and gui huehuehue wait you want me to type simple settings in a shell to configure my vm once in a while?
you just shittalk about them a lot
Aqua doesn't suck too much
you still trash talk it
compare it to gnome
Aqua/macOS is too except it's actually nice to use
I had my mother try gnome once
I had to put her on gnome flashback
even then she didn't know how to start an application
basically gnome 2-like gnome 3
that's what redhat uses
because they're not stupid enough to use gnome 3's default shit
to be fair she doesn't know how to start shit on windows either
she just keeps everything on her desktop
by everything I mean a web browser and maybe 20000 photos
that she downloads from facebook
no she keeps everything on her desktop
then it breaks every release
what you want them to render left to right?
not on this slow fucking website
I need to make the switch to zfs on this sometime
I have everything ready already
zfs is in every kernel I build now automatically
they basically control the media and have too much political power
I'm in Quebec though
r u creepin my github again
oh only 700 lines
I might try grml someday but if it doesn't act like tcsh I might just not like it
also I have no reason to use zsh anymore since I fixed tcsh on musl
i want to see your profile pic
I wanted it to be systemd in the shape of a dick
safari is the only good webkit browser
can't remember what spotlight does
siri is fun to say dirty things to
I like spotlight actually
cmd+space and it does everything you want
everything for you <3
plus if you want to go about the basic applications gnome doesn't have much to compete with
spotlight is great imo
depends how far you want to go
but if you want anything meaningful you'll have to use Xquartz
idc it's just a launcher
krunner or spotlight I just start to type the name of something and it launches
that's all I care about
I don't pay attention to it
literally all I do is press alt+space and enter the name of something and it launches
that's all I need it for and they both do their job very well
well I don't know enough about either to judge them on anything else
I've actually never paid attention to any of them, I've just integrated them in my workflow without even thinking about it
which is a win imo
the moment it fails is job is when I would've had to look into it and complain
there's that too, but I usually use it to browse my shit instead
you have a tarantula?
I barely use any of them anyway
I use safari sometimes, although it's nightly
and anyway can you really say that you like gnome applications?
I played bsd-robots on that thing
talking about macOS 9 I know you're memeposting
you couldn't possible believe that macOS is worse than freedesktopware
it's the only good desktop OS after all
the fuck is eye of gnome
gtk3 IS a pain in the ass
and gtk2 is outdated
if they finally used a decent programming language it would become the best
.q add weeb I like GTK3
it should stay that way
>settings don't allow you to actually set anything
join #bsdmasterrace real quick
I know but spamming isn't
im waiting for shiro
cat boys are nice
we're all fags tho

your body crumbles?
whatever that quote is
if we all worked together to reverse engineer cocoa
we might have a chance
that would just ruin a perfectly good qt
is this twm
oh well i am go to bed bratan
how the hell do you hotplug a CPU
or is this about activating a CPU that wasn't activated at boot or something
>hi im gnu i put social pressure on people to force them to acknowledge me
wouldn't that just make i=0?
why did you post this
r/place is cancer though
fitting for a community like 4chan
even the good boards are shit now
that used to be only true for /b/, /pol/ and /r9k/ Snoo63294
also get a fuckin nick
anyway now you can't even have a wallpaper thread on /wg/ without some cunt posting nazi wallpapers
please don't say that word
I am a person of very light colour I'll have you know
PERSON. OF. VERY. LIGHT. COLOUR.
anyway how bout that st-pb bommin boys?
I tried to turn the anarcho-feminist flag back into anarcho-communist
but they didnt let me
I was from the red side
they tried so hard
I feel no remorse
also what happened with the void?
did they turn it into green lattice?
oh no it's there
I thought it was more right
I didn't see that
aren't you a brony
awsn't there someone here who was a brony
go back to OSU you fucking weeb
I don't think I have a single pixel in the end shot
all I did was add a red pixel to the anarcho-feminist flag once in a while
implying arch-based distros have good parts
nah the archwiki isn't nice
it's a huge shitshow
you'd get the same documentation from manpages and config file comments
maybe you used the x64 iso on a 32 bit thinkpad? how old is it?
what exactly is the error
did it just hang?
maybe your usb stick or the disk image is corrupted
we are a single entity
this question is meaningless as we have evolved past emotions
we would do no such thing
I mean except for justJanne if there's one person you don't want to fuck with online it's justJanne I'm convinced of it
she'll *virtually* find you and turn the whole nation of Germany against you
we have a nsfw channel called #lmr_after_dark
mostly furry shit because of our fascist mods
but mostly gay shit minus the furry
although the furry is gay too
what the fuck do you think I am
you can't hide now
oh shit I just realised
just how much did you get pinged on the snoonet channels in the last few days
you don't want to know
clang on openindiana pulls gcc
I don't know why I'm even surprised, they're using gnu coreutils, pulseaudio and mate
tsahyt openindiana is literally your non-linux wetdream
except you like linux
would you happen to know what driver you're using with it?
justJanne 285 and 290 are supported
I used to hate my 285 now I love it just because of how much progress amdgpu has made
harry potter isn't even very good
you should make a stallman.org markov chain
taking in stallman blog posts
>I am looking for people to help web sites put free licenses on their Javascript code.
Misero please make a channel to test your bot
you guessed well
that's the best starting point
and it's just a boring corporate language which will soon be replaced by the bunch of new corporate languages like go and rust
and that brings about the digusting corporate culture around java
which is the worst part about it
like javascript, like C++, etc.
nah 1932 was enough
don't want that to happen again
Ich bin eine kleine Katze
what the fuck is that [nazi humor] about
it's a fuckin movie
what the hell is apricity os
you shouldn't like arch
>hi we only test 1/10th of our packages and avoid optional dependencies but you can't roll back an update unless you have the old packages cached taking up space
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.9.2 on Funtoo GNU/Linux 2017-02-26 powered by Linux 4.10.8, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4100 MHz, RAM: 3898/7988 MB, Storage: 183/207 GB, 978 procs, 0.43h up
well you shouldn't that's the point
funtoo is mostly the same with a few improvements
why do you even want systemd
everything works fine without it
the fuck is this
unixbird loves slackware but nobody actually uses it here
meh it's still better than arch for some purposes if you put pkgsrc on it
but yeah you should use gentoo instead
it should still be
you failed installing opensuse because you fucked up though
it's not because it "doesn't agree with your pc"
but why the fuck would you remove your windows efi partition
without backing up the contents either
you shouldn't even remove it
you can use more than one efi partition
when the fuck are they going to use mir as default
just go RIGHT BACK to void
why am i clicking this radi
just use openindiana
it's basically true unix linux
the hell is 9front
oh it's plan9?
I'm pretty sure they do unless that's in pkgsrc current
a good, dying distro
weeb is a plan9 fanboy though
......what's the difference between linux and hurd?
they're 2 completely different operating systems
and plan9 is hybrid
>the kernel is bigger, obviously they could develop it faster!
I don't know them by heart.. libXrandr, bison, a compiler, libXinerama, libXkb
I think that's it
but how can you claim that that time is more than actually writing thousands of lines of code
and the suffix is -dev
also why the fuck are you on ubuntu
that's because hurd is pretty much obsolete these days
only gentoo stable has 1.8
~amd64 has 2.0.14 or something
I'm not saying it's obsolete because of its features, I'm saying it's obsolete because only 8 people use it, only in virtual machine
don't worry it's just rdv2 not even the real thing
anyway it's that time again
just tried gnome again in fedora's live CD, I couldn't bring myself to actually install it to try it further
how can you like this
what keyboard shortcuts?
the ones you can't configure?
what's that supposed to do justsomeguy
you know I actually used to use gnome 3
I couldn't get past the live CD because it reminded me why I stopped using it
I mean wayland is the only good reason to actually use gnome
but be fucking honest about this being the reason
I get that your favourite DE is the shittiest one
even with, they're really fucking limited
not to mention that gnome shell is fucking horrible
plasma is much better
he's talkin shit about windows
you just gonna take it
my things don't
you can just modify that shit
and you don't have to use krunner
plasma is fully modular
how is it not consistent
that's most people's issue
and is your only reason "lel no greyscale"
of course because they're not cwm groups
besides does Gnome have cwm groups?
how is gnome better than anything
that's a nice buggy javascript-based engine that everything relies on tho
there's a gtk application in there and a VTE application
you can remove the menubar from all of them, after that the other three are absolutely fine
actually that's just gedit isn't it
yeah because gnome made it impossible for gtk3 applications to integrate into anything but gnome
just the fact that gedit looks so good in KDE that it can be mistaken for a KDE app is decent
>hi nothing integrates in KDE
>my examples include 3 applications that don't integrate in anything except gnome
KDE integrates in KDE perfectly
and they try their damn hardest to make CSD-bugged bullshit to fit
KWin on wayland will force server-side decorations
what are you even talking about
you just lost all your points and you're still shitposting
yeah what's wrong with it
I gave you an example
you can literally just have the box with the files in if you want
and even if you hate dolphin, you can replace that with what you prefer
and it'll fit as long as it's either qt or gtk if you don't have a colour scheme
because gtk doesn't handle fucking colour schemes
if you hate dolphin that much why not use pcmanfm-qt
why is gnome better than plasma now
that's already been settled
is there anything wrong with pcmanfm-qt?
well why are you taking it as an example to why plasma is worse than gnome
you know you have no arguments, you know you're wrong
your only reason is your greyscale bullshit and your special snowflake mouse
you still claim gnome is better
that's all it is
you haven't given me a reason to think otherwise
you can make it not convoluted
scripting windows is officially supported
how is that not real power
you can set window-specific settings
or application-specific settings for every window of that application
you can remove any part of the UI on most good qt applications that come with it
we're talking about a DE
we're not talking about cwm
I'm trying to get you to say that gnome's shit next to plasma
because you know it is
you're just talking about the file manager not the DE
we've already settled that
you can change it
it's the gnome shell plus gtk3 bullshit
also the KDE equivalent to the gnome shell is the plasma shell
>hi i have a compositor but i still have shitty vsync
>but I try so you still get the performance loss
you've only been talking about individual applications
what the fuck is wrong
in KDE if you'd rather have something else handle vsync or you don't want the compositor to be too heavy you can switch your rendering backend to xrender, turn off vsync, put everything to the most minimal settings
how isn't that efficient
that's because it turns off the compositor when you have a fullscreen application
unless you tell it otherwise
that depends on who you target
plasma has the advantage of being highly customizable and modular while being easy as fuck to use to new users
gnome is just "HIDE EVERYTHING FROM THEM, REMOVE EVERY FEATURE THAT MIGHT BREAK SOMETHING"
"THEY MUST NOT CALL REDHAT SUPPORT OR LENNART WILL HAVE TO SUCK THE CEO'S DICK AGAIN"
who cares about emacs users
why are you even bringing this up
imo emacs users are probably using mate
just because they're stuck in the past
you haven't given me a reason to think it's not
and you can change colour scheme instead of having gnome-looks filled with recolours of adwaita
most of these recolours being broken
because of gtk3 updates
don't you see the point I'm making
that's a huge fucking design issue
numix is basically a workaround just because they actually programmed an engine around a fucking theme
they don't like customization? Gnome is the most themed shit on the planet
>hi we know what community we have but we hate customization so too bad for th em lololololololololololol
by gnome I meant gtk
that's not the problem
gnome is funded by redhat which make their money on customer support
the logic behind gnome is that if your system literally can't break, redhat won't have to spend as much money in customer support while charging the same thing
gnome is a byproduct of corporate greed, it's made for corporations and enterprises for code monkeys and slaves to work on and have their bosses invest in support
that's the same fucking shit for wayland, for systemd, etc.
they want their customers to not be able to break shit, even if they do think they're that 10000000th visitor
they want anything in their little code monkey box to have no impact on the system whatsoever, they want to make a metal box for the monkey
all that works is the little code monkey's interface
that's what gnome and freedesktopware is about
it started as an enthusiast project from an edgy german in the 90's
idk shit about it
it started as a KDE clone yeah
by default it is I agree
have you ever tried to make it look nice
stop this meme we've already been over it
and most of these are because the window is too small anyway
the person who took taht pic resized it just enough so that the scrollbars show while being useless
still no example of how KDE doesn't have one look
unless you take gnome 3 CSD bullshit
or things that are just impossible to integrate in anything
what's your point
just having a bunch of random information listed in a menu?
"well I want the date, it'll be at the same place as my notifications and music for sure!"
"AND HOW ABOUT THAT WEATHER?"
gnome doesn't handle them well
on macOS you get your notifications listed on a single menu
there's a tab to these random informations
same thing for plasma btw, you get a new icon on the taskbar and you click on it, it'll show you all your notifications and disappear
task bars shouldn't be cluttered either, that's just mismanagement
the default settings on all KDE applications is, if there's anything new that the user should notice, it'll show up in the taskbar
otherwise, get back in that menu, disappear
there's too much information thrown at me
I just want my fucking notifications
why are they crammed below my music and left of my calendar
this is so cluttered
DON'T GIVE THEM THE SAME FUCKING MENU
music control goes with music control
if you want me to give you another macOS example, when you get a music notification, you get the music control right in the notification
you don't get a whole fucking module to control music to clutter your notifications list
yeah, well it's enough
why don't they put these buttons in the notifications in the menu if they're relevant
and not clutter the damn menu
that's not my point
my point is that the damn menu is cluttered and I get thrown too much information at my face when I look at it
so it's bad at everything
if I want the date or the weather I have to look at my music, notifications, the other thing, then I find it
a single fucking menu for the notifications that's it
if I wanted fucking weather widgets I'd add them myself
either in another tab in that menu, in the top bar, or in that split window, etc. but of course you can't modify shit in gnome yeah?
you could add the weather extension
but it's already there cluttering your damn notification menu
maybe your only chance at getting a decent interface is installing an extension that force-disables this shit and gives you a proper menu
it's the same shit
it's a menu where you can look at your notifications
and ideally interact with them
the only difference between what we're saying is you're using a buzzword
so why are you making an argument based on something that's not even real
that's why I'm an exhibitionist
brushes the shyness right off
I stopped being shy in public when I realised that everybody just thinks of themselves more than you
nobody will notice and remember anything you do unless it's huge
I'm guessing you partied a lot
yeah I've never done that though
I've gone to a few parties, left before it became too crazy, I usually try to avoid them because they're boring
good thing I never started
I prefer hating my life and sliding towards madness alone thank you very much
yeah I'm sure some people find that sort of thing fun but it really doesn't appeal to me
the only kind of parties that I like are just chatting and doing whatever with like 5 people you know well
great, you can test voice to text technology
or whatever its formal name is
SORRY EVERYBODY I'M TRYING OUT VOICE TO TEXT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE TYPING
or just try to get your laptop to pick up the professor's voice
what's the difference between professor and teacher in english btw
in french it's just one word
here everyone's a professor
Tu vas avoir à le faire toi-même j'aime pas les chevaux de cette façon là ;)
well at least I don't like horse cum
and my flag is red thank you very much
how dare you talk about the canadian flag like that
why would you think that?
what'd it look like
did you make it in C
that's pretty much me every day
except for days where I do things
got a chemistry lab today
my plans are all made from now until university :D
technically I should be able to enter university now though but I won't because that'd be just paying for an extra year for classes that are basically free here
wait what made you laugh
I mean that's what you're saying in french you know
anyhow have fun dealing with the guy doing his presentation thinking you're an asshole from now on though
I'm lying though unless you're in a small class or you know him he won't remember your face in 5 minutes chrisc
nobody gives a shit about anyone
that's what you have to realise
NOOO MY ONLY WEAKNESS crystalmett
I really want to learn C++ just because of all the interesting projects using it but then again it's C++
i like my cute people with benis
I'm not ashamed cause I'm not weeb
IM A FUCKING WEEB
I mean I could probably just invent a sexual orientation if I need it
and tell everyone how much of a shitlord they are for not knowing it
you better get it right
I mean I don't like to fuck complete strangers
my ss13 server is down :(
I meant it as
I only fuck some men if I have feelings for them, but I fuck the shit out of everything that has feminine features
DAMN TUMBLR TOOK ER GENDR
HOW DARE YOU NOT LET ME HAVE A SEXUAL ORIENTATION TO IDENTIFY TO
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU
oh god my PTSD is kicking in
I have deep trauma from people assuming I liked gay men just because I like feminine men
damn right ;)
please don't bring up my testicular cancer
wait you're making a joke
I fuck the shit out of anything that isn't Jennifer-Lawrence
oh god somebody must've tried that
I can see it
>hi I'm waifusexual i only fuck my waifu uguuu!
honestly though if you have a dick I'd fuck you
oh god.. the PTSD is kicking in again
won't you grow a dick for me please
I can't hold it any longer
welcome to the glorious Nipponese empire, our people is so alienated that they can't even stay together long enough to make children
welcome little nipponese peasant, don't you love buying sex and feelings of love and affection as a commodity?
you can also buy excitement as a commodity through our over the top reality TV shows and anime
it's like your life was never boring and miserable and you're not going to kill yourself when you're too old to work!
fuck you I'm working on the hammer and sickle
who the fuck put that pink pixel there
I know it's you weeb
it's better documented though
use.. a good version?
music sheet to midi
don't pretend there aren't nearly perfect versions of big classical pieces out there
that's what the os in osu stands for
.yt let it go meme
expectocode specifically anything that resembles the name "qttools"
qt-devel would be more headers though
the outdated version would be
I need a temporary distro to switch to zfs from
actually I could dd this partition to another and boot that
linux is an operating system not a human
that would be dangerous while switching partitions
mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt && pc -R /dev /mnt/dev
and it rm -rf /
both the current install and the one I have mounted
let me see what drives I have
linux is an operating system
GNU is the userspace
the operating system is designed to control hardware
the userspace is not part of the operating system
and GNU is a multi-platform set of tools and libraries
GNU is an application suite
GNU+Linux is stallman's last grasp on his dream of a "GNU operating system"
telling himself in his little manchild mind that he actually accomplished the GNU operating system
even though that was Hurd
"they did the whole thing besides the kernel"
how big a kernel is
the biggest part of GNU is gcc
why do you think GNU couldn't make their own kernel
because a kernel is a shitton of work
too much for GNU
and good kernel design is hard as fuck
but the kmods are part of the operating system
more than GNU is anyway
because the kmods can be made builtin anyway, the kernel is a platform on which  to develop hardware support
in modern days at least
what are you trying to say
our conversation is about GNU not being a part of the OS
I immediately conceded to you that kmods are a part of the OS though
GNU is an OS
and its only kernel is hurd
and an extensive collection of computer software
this is the part we use on linux
linux libre is only a configuration of linux
it's not the GNU operating system either
unless GNU actually forked linux and renamed it in their name
what should my temporary distro be
I was thinking of slackware honestly
a temporary distro is a decent reason to use slackware
because I'm only using it to manage my main distro's filesystem
I'll have to tar the rootfs to back it up, manage the filesystem which will delete everything inside and untar it back
the process will take too much time and a liveOS isn't stable enough
plus I need the OS to be usable in the meantime
sorry I need 21st century support
I don't like being stuck in 500 BC
probably, I'd need too much for it to be usable though
because I'd be running it on an easily corruptable flash
but I'd like for it to be a usable desktop OS in the meantime
because tarring and untarring 150G of porn (and vital OS files) takes a while
how is using a second OS to back up and manage my first OS a waste but setting up a snapshot system after setting up a hyperviser to run my main OS on not
I feel like for single use the first one is much better
letting my computer run more than 12 hours on a live OS based on a flash drive is not smart though
it's not a backup, I'm tarring the whole fucking rootfs because I'm about to wipe the partition
opensuse it is then
there's a new youtube UI?
looks the same to me
I'm not sure that I'm willing to go through the opensuse installer again though
no, fedora will just try to make whatever partition it wants like it owns the damn drive
I really just need a new userspace
why would I stay on a cheap flash drive for over 12 hours
I don't care what OS I'm on this won't work
that's implying I have a DVD in 2017
I was talking to unixbird
I'm good though, I think slackware is what I need actually
I paid my flash drive 10 bucks about 2 years ago and I've used it a ton, a lot of dds went through it
I don't trust that shit
I'm thinking either debian or slackware anyway
I was sick of being indecisive so I just used the fedora that I had already on my drive
this was probably a mistake
anyway these fucking beeps are the most annoying shit I've ever heard
fuck off I know I tried to delete an empty character leave me alone
for the first time I guess
I need to rebuild my kernel before doing anything thuogh
also why sup instead of alt
what's wrong with them
..because X11 has always used alt as window management hotkeys?
as far as I know anyway
it's alt left click
what applications use alt left click?
that's an issue with the makers of those applications not the DE
we've always used alt+left click to move windows
anyway I'm done compiling the kernel
and i'll probably end up installing KDE within the first 5 minutes
this is actually unusable
how can you like this
oh god the beeps
wew terminal bell disabled
I'm installing KDE as soon as my update is done
I wish it would stop prompting me
I wish it could stop darkening the whole fucking screen to prompt me
because I'm on it
and it's fucking horrible
I take it back weeb
wayland isn't worth it
nothing in the world is worth being stuck on this
why is everything so big
what the fuck is that sound
what did I just hear
you call that a usable, integrated dark theme? http://i.imgur.com/Q9L9z3E.png
I do blame firefox devs
I also blame gnome devs for making this piece of shit
even mate is better than this
I understand why a lot of people are stuck on gnome 2 now
adwaita is anything but glorious
it looks like actual trash
yeah I'm not impressed
9and look at the firefox buttons
why won't this update finally stop so that I can install plasma
now firefox won't let me visit any website because "my connection is not secure"
and I've just updated it
dark themes are obviously fixed yeah http://i.imgur.com/6sm8kj1.jpg
>not adding extension after extension and script after script just to make anything usable
>well its not supported lol what can i say
BUT OH GOD KDE INTEGRATION IS SO SHIT HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN WHAT GEDIT LOOKS LIKE ?!
capitalism is not divine
gnome will be obsolete after kwin on wayland is done
I should have installed opensuse
I symlinked dnf to pkg though
at least I can try to pretend
now if you'll excuse me I'm getting out of this horrible environment
I feel better
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.8.6 on Fedora 25 (Workstation Edition) powered by Linux 4.8.6-300.fc25.x86_64, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4100 MHz, RAM: 2363/7996 MB, Storage: 6/540 GB, 267 procs, 0.2h up

or else the world might implode
weeb tar is started
the fuck is this
this absolutely can't feel good
weeb I'm using pxz though so it shouldn't be too long I guess
weeb for what distro again?
as much as I hate gnome, it's still better than shittier gnome
weeb just use zfs
weeb you can just make a single pool and have something more dynamic
weeb it'd be treated as a single partition on both your drives
make a pool, a swap volume, a root volume, etc.
pretty sure you can tell it which drive to use specifically even though you have a single pool
just read zfs documentation there's definitely a way to work this out
weeb don't install gnome
weeb how does your mouse only work on wayland but not X11
can't you just use libinput?
weeb so far it's going well though, I set warnings to all and haven't got any yet
iownall555 why the fuck are you on gnome
that's where you're wrong though
the KDE spin is really good, although it's on 5.8
and 5.9 is fucking amazing
if it did how would you get it to change the background of only one monitor
Materiyolo the same as on every other linux distro?
fedora is pretty on point with their drivers though
yeah you need to open the desktop settings for each individual desktop
that one's a bit redundant
I could suggest them to just tab it
weeb stop shilling for gnome
and what even are hybrid graphics
weeb we've talked about this yesterday you don't have shit against kde
the only reason you're using it is your special snowflake mouse and your greyscale bullshit weeb 
plus I don't even know what you mean by "support hybrid graphics"
isn't that a kernel feature anyway?
it's a fucking driver
Protheus you just called cwm horseshit?
weeb what are fucking hybrid graphics though
"proteus and shit" doesn't tell me anything
weeb you can set this with environment variables and this https://github.com/hadess/switcheroo-control/
plus that's really only an issue if you actually do switch cards
if you've got a GPU why the hell would you not just stick to that unless you're virtualizing with it?
and even then you can't change which card your whole desktop runs on
I don't even know what optimus is and by the sounds of it I don't want to
but you can't switch your whole desktop's graphics card
what's even the opint
so.. you switch cards... because... battery? but you don't care about everything else draining battery?
I mean you could just modify desktop files to launch specific applications with a specific GPU but sure
so you're shilling gnome because of your special snowflake mouse, your greyscale bullshit and because you're too lazy to edit a desktop file once
weeb how would what work out
weeb you don't realise how little of a shit I care about this blog post
because KDE is the only good DE
and there's only room for one only good DE
zawaken we've argued this before and he lost every point
I don't want MS to implement anything
they should just make it quicker
but that doesn't make gnome any good
weeb you just have to launch shit with the DRI_PRIME env variable set though
how hard can it be
anyway no warnings yet on the tar
hopefully the extract will be quicker
did they officially announce that?
Materiyolo that's a nice openbox panel you got there
>currently, we have no plans to release the source code
YOU LIED TO US LISA
weeb the best keyboard is in alphabetical order
weeb also I'm glad I didn't preorder that keyboard because they use burgerland notation, they weren't going to receive it 5th of april, it was 4th of may
I wanted to preorder a keyboard on mechanicalkeyboards.com
and I thought they'd receive it today
so I decided to just wait
but they use the braindead date notation
so I would've had to wait another month
weeb it is, I'll just wait before buying it
if I want to
that's what I just said
you should just embrace the ZFS
then you should try a decent distro
was going to say
didn't even know you had a desktop
weeb what kind of server
did you spend 5000$ on an IBM POWER8?
that server's gonna be trash....
Materiyolo they forgot greenland
nobody should forget greenland, it's going to melt on us one day and stop the flow of hot air to europe inducing a new ice age
then russia will conquer europe because russian winter will be europe-wide
weeb I'm trying to make you proud here
Materiyolo no that's iceland
weeb don't you see me memeposting about global warming just like you taught me senpai
Materiyolo he's drawing in arpeggios, it literally can't sound bad
it's usually what people use to make synthetical/generated music not sound like cacophony
weeb you know they can't
thank god most channels are lowered to where you nearly can't hear them
you hear like 5 notes when there are 30 playing
they're only loud enough because the others are lowered
still tarring all my shit
fedora's theme is nice but it's missing so many great additions from 5.9
they reworked the toolbars, you can put the menu bar in different places removing it form the window, etc.
what was that bug
that's probably an issue with the distro overwriting your configs
Taylor-Swift make sure you run an update before ricing
I found AB49K guys http://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2017/04/05/drunk-lives-matter-dui/
yay home folder almost done compressing
not that much more to go after that
the libs are just symlinks
so I think it's done
weeb if I want to try a trackball which one should I try
what about this one https://www.amazon.ca/Kensington-K72337US-Orbit-Trackball-Scroll/dp/B002OOWB3O/ref=pd_bxgy_147_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=J0CPMAFFC3C6XYKRHX5R
if I just want to try it
you think I use exercise balls?
what do you even mean by exercise balls?
I thought you were talking about those shitty yoga balls that girls use to pretend they train
what the hell even is this
what are they for
i've never seen one of those in my life
1. finger 2. you know i like it big bby ;) 3. refer to #2 4. yes
TuxFuk well clits won't move your mouse on a screen
oh you mean clitmouse
idk I've never been able to really use a clitmouse
weeb what about the one I posted
I'll try it then but I might not be able to buy a new keyboard
nah I just think those big balls look interesting
not into the mouse-like ones
I'll make a decision tomorrow
maybe I could buy a cheap black-switch keyboard
or just go the tuxfuk way and build it
I want a semi-heavy linear switch
it's either black or nature white
and nature white is impossible to get
why would I want this
depends on your init system
if anything else no
I'm setting up zfs
weeb are caps good
weeb I'm wondering if I should call my volumes pool/ROOT or pool/root
weeb I have / /usr /home and /var/tmp/portage to isolate my builddir
anything else you can think of?
so you're saying I should make a new zfs filesystem for every subdir I create
gonna have to make a script..
that's good for now I can probably just add them later anyway
it's like creating a new partition except it's less scary
No known data errors
shiro this is actually creepy as fuck
now idk if I should copy or move my backup
there we go, just have to copy a 138G tarfile and then I can hopefully successfully extract it
Materiyolo unless you want to make it public just setting up an ftp server on a raspberry pi would be enough
I mean they can probably merge their efforts into their local version of gnome
I'm glad unity is finally dead though
why can't every distro use this gnome by default though http://distrowatch.com/images/cgfjoewdlbc/redhat.png
and make it wayland
this should be the default
Arsen[m] they're still working on wayland support
yeah it's not ready yet
I tried gnome yesterday again, I couldn't stand it
I did try though
man MGS4 has the worst ost
except for old snake
maybe I should make an illumos distribution
actually I could probably make it xbps-based
just make void on illumos
I think I'll actually look into doing that when I get funtoo back
tsahyt I'm migrating funtoo to openzfs <3
and I installed fedora as a temporary distribution to do it from
I called my zpool funpool
Arsen[m] that thumbnail is cancer
weeb look at what they did to the miniplayer https://u.teknik.io/Kokab.png
weeb this is what it used to look like https://u.teknik.io/UB5nU.png
it's bigger and uglier
why did they do it
not with this player
> (weabot) [54/77] <weabot> only good visual novel is everlasting summer
> (weabot) [77/77] <weabot> you think I use exercise balls?
weeb you know what I want to quote anyway
you added it yourself yesterday
nothing like shilling proprietary software
you still shill gnome
I've never used spotify though so I wouldn't know
I should modify weechat to use libedit
and switch to that
this way I could make :q work
and probably even :wq to save the chat sessions
I'll note it in my TODO file when I get my distor back
weeb japan is a shithole
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.9.2 on Funtoo GNU/Linux 2017-02-26 powered by Linux 4.10.8, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4100 MHz, RAM: 2154/7988 MB, Storage: 0/0 GB, 960 procs, 0.02h up
sysinfo doesn't give you the filesystem
seriously though the switch went flawlessly
it couldn't have gone better
I'll be trying to port void to illumos next
there's only one package that you don't have and it's never updated
I need a new keyboard and I like linear switches, anybody has a suggestion?
the fuck is up with all these broken keyboards https://mykeyboard.eu/catalogue/md600-rgb-white-mx-nature-white_141/
np I guess, not into broken keyboard meself
although I really want to find somewhere where I can buy one with nature white switches
anyway whatever I'm just playing on wasdkeyboard now
it doesn't even look good
look at my masterpiece http://i.imgur.com/cZFP4Ju.png
why the fuck would I pay as much as a regular keyboard to assemble my own keyboard
I'm almost thinking of just buying a building kit and build it myself
there are just no good keyboards out there
how long did it take you to build your clueboard
do you need to handwire it?
so I can just add the switches to the PCB and it's done?
I thought it'd be harder
mostly it's because I can't find a fucking keyboard that I like
most good switches don't have keyboards, most keyboards don't have good switches
oh you bought a keyboard controller
what switches do you have
what you hardcoded your layout?
so you basically just made the qwerty layout see it as dvorak?
what if you choose dvorak in your OS
I really want either gateron yellow or cherry mx nature white
how does that work if you have to switch layouts
I have to switch layouts because of.. you know.. different languages
is he there rn?
I'll message him tomorrow then
goin to sleep now
what was that trackball I should get again
is this any good
i think it doesnt sroll
looking for a cheap on
it looks better
and it's only 10$ more but I get free shipping on it
by looks better I mean actual looks
that girl in the video looks like someone's holding a gun to her head
not nvim, neovim
neovim has a qt GUI so it's actually good
even though the qt GUI behaves exactly like the terminal does
yeah it  turned me off
>scroll with the ball
sounds annoying as fuck
because I read the first 3 letters and think you're talking about nvi and my eyes light up for a second thinking you're actually using good software but then I read the last letter
what t he fuck is a gvim
what the fuck is wrong with you
on macOS /dev/tty is piped to terminal <3
so no emulation going on there <3
you can use zfs on macOS
yacc isn't a make target
HUE HUEEEE TOO SLOOOW ;))))
o shit metheads my only weakness
>everything is an opinion
funny thing is that's literally all zinixbot does now with the .distro thing
unixbird probably just keeps it to see if his server crashes
the fuck did you just say about kde you fucker
nah I'm with you on arch
most people here are with you on arch
there's literally no good reason to use it
of course it is, but they're 2 different distros
oh hi weeb just the right time
if you can sit through the compile gentoo is the best distribution to use anyway
because with arch you're stuck with the maintainer's decisions, they avoid optional dependencies so that means a package will pull everything remotely related to it, and if they have to make a choice between 2 dependencies they'll make the choice and leave you to deal with it
most packages are barely tested and if it breaks you have nothing to roll back the update unless you still have the old packages backed up
not really, the wiki's run by selfish nerds who take over whole pages just for the merit but they write shitty documentations, and if you make a change they'll revert it because it's their fucking page
the wiki's a fucking shitfest
the wiki's easily replaceable by man pages
and if you want a wiki, the gentoo wiki's much better
it's more compact but gives you more informations and examples
just less useless shit all around
except for the kernel shit
well on slackware they don't give you dependencies because you should install them by hand, on gentoo they give you the dependencies that you'll need for the bare minimum and if you need any optional ones you can just enable them with use flags
I prefer opensuse for most purposes
yeah I posted in it didn't i
so redhat won
that's possible with most distros though
I haven't gotten it to work well on opensuse though I think it's too heavily patched
looks like you've found the system dees
where's the registered logo
WHERE IS IT WEEB
of course, they can't
I can't find it on the gpl
3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific prior written permission.
where is that in the gpl
can I fork glibc, sell it and say "AYY STALLMAN APPROVES"
on many terms he wasn't tbh
I mean he's like marx, he was right on his analysis but not in response
idk I'm on qupzilla
>you're left with the rest of KDE
you can easily run plasma without those
and most distributions have you install a different meta package for the kde-apps
they only give you the bare minimum like dolphin and konsole
like 3-4 kde apps
no, you want plasma workspace
mpv is sdl isn't it
there are good mpv clients for both gnome and plasma though
mpv is sdl which is really great in itself
that's what I'm using right now I think
because it's based on qtwebengine which is basically chromium
yeah it comes with a vpn service by default
especially for melmeiro[m]'s uses weeb
also I looked a bit more into the kensington trackball and they actually look like crap
you need some malware to program the buttons and they're not even put in the firmware?
the fuck is wrong with them?
that's what I looked into
it actually looks like shit
I said kensington looks like trash, slimblad is no exception
just show me alternatives
I'll decide what I want to get
just join the kurds
that looks like something from the 90's
as good as people who are at war against both the turkey and ISIS can do
why are there no good trackballs
I'm not saying kensington looks ugly
I'm saying you need to install malware on windows to program the buttons and that shit doesn't even stay in firmware
yeah I saw a review of a linux user using it
he said the 2 buttons at the top are useless
thought nvidia was working on wayland support
by wayland I mean kms
buy decent hardware
it's 110$ though
for something i don't even know whether I'll like
what problems and what drivers
with recent amdgpu-compatible cards that's not a problem anymore
I had an issue finding a distro that worked with my r9 285 just last year, now everything works out of the box
I don't even have to think about it
even fedora doesn't come with xf86-video-amdgpu by default and everything works just fine without it
well as much as X11 can work
that's very good actually, they made a lot of progress
I mean you won't get huge gaming rid PCMR performance but any R9 card will handle most games just fine
well R9 or RX
I get about 240 fps on windows on CSGO, about 150-200 on linux with open amdgpu
I have 2G vram
that's a huge reason why I went for amd
nvidia is such a pain in the ass all aroudn
especially if you want to do just some gaming
I remember that I was trying to play CSGO on nvidia, on the nouveau drivers it was black and white or something
and on the nvidia proprietary I had an opengl error
man neovim-qt looks like trash
https://u.teknik.io/gyyhf.png it's literally just the same as a terminal
there are no distinguishable GUI features in there
why not just use the terminal thuogh
alright, curses then
still there's no reason for it to rely on X
>hi we're gonna spend millions of dollars in bombs just because some newspapers think I like this guy
everybody does I think
a lot of countries do
.tv rick and morty
fuck you gonzo you're lying
don't do this to yourself
it's pretty much useless when GPT partitions exist
except for use with luks
or.. you can patch your kernel
nah, Apple's kernel is as open as linux and it's hybrid
so there's actually technically less rules by random-nick's logic
the whole kernel and userspace is open, only their graphical frameworks aren't
they make heavy use of binary firmware, drivers and modules though
it's not about that it's that they have less requirements than linux, they really don't care about drivers/modules/firmware to be binary
I mean regardless of what you're using, a kernel is such a huge piece of software that you're always playing by somebody else's rules no matter what
even in a microkernel
it's funny how literally the only popular fully closed operating system is windows
following that is oracle's dead solaris
otherwise it's all open
you know it bby ;)
that's why I specified oracle solaris
they have the legal right to though
they might have snuck in bsd code but it's still closed
apple is already open
except for the graphical frameworks
at least since the 2000's
this is their kernel
their libc, unix utilities, etc. are all open
most of their core stuff is open
XCode is largely open
they contribute a lot to llvm/clang and use it mainly, and it's open
and safari/webkit is open
safari in most parts because of webkit
I mean XNU/Darwin was supposed to be a fully open operating system, they just added all the proprietary apple stuff to it to make macOS
which mostly consists of their graphical frameworks
cups is by apple
but Apple's entire operating system part is open
when it could easily be entirely closed
that really depends on the version of android
if you use the samsung-provided one
iOS is still on XNU/Darwin and it's based on webkit which is still open
again, the only closed parts of iOS are the graphical frameworks which iOS extensively uses, which is what would make it seem more closed
not by much if you go in terms of how much software is closed
again if you go by samsung's release of android
I usually use slock
slock is x-based, vlock sounds like it's tty/kernel based
never tried vlock though
just have to switch to tty I'm guessing
of course it's x-based
that's the issue though
especially if you use startx
that's much easier to get around though
hi how's it going
this is a black screen
i dont get it
they haven't been good since the 80's
I have a new meme
>There is a campaign to spread distrust for the FSF. It resembles the campaign to spread denial of global heating.
I messaged rms about the GPL, he ignored everything and said this
I proposed arguments and solutions that he completely ignored
>hi I'm a doctor who's built his whole career by ignoring arguments
I made a temp account for this
by the way that was in response to an email that I probably wrote something like 5000 characters into
I only use it for leftypol and cuteboys
I don't wanna post that shit on 4chan
pm me your email
anyone else want 3556 char message?
Linux is an operating system and GNU has no part in its name
although stallman does love to play with definitions
GNU was a mistake
they should've just ported BSD libc and utilities
wat its only 3PM
Mon Apr 10 15:24:10 EDT 2017
no it's definitely 3PM
the design is also a huge ripoff of safari
except with even less settings than safari somehow
it probably can MrNeon
there must be an rpmfusion one then?
then grab it from google
or.. use google chrome with the fedora installer
wtf it's made in rust?
let let let let let let let let let
rust is the next big corporate language like C++ and java
which will make fucking huge, fucking ugly and fucking unstable
I don't have libreoffice to test :/
it can put the menubar in the title bar though
and its title bars are much smaller than Gnome's monsters
that's true for KDE too
no I haven't started yet
sounds a lot like void
except for the clang part
so you basically just want void on an llvm-patched kernel?
more like the thing that makes your simplified code into what you actually expect it to become
I assume dbus is an exponential
>X reliant terminal emulator with no features at all
>not relying on either gtk, qt or sdl to pretend that you're not on a shitty 30 year old graphical server
tsahyt lied to you
it's just an irc bot written in haskell
not even a god
yeah but those are unusable
it's not about how many resources it uses though unless you're on a very very weak machine
it's about what you get for that
there are no good non-pre 2014 macbook laptops anyway though
you should just give up on laptops and buy xiaomi phones
not even that
>hi we have a shitty battery but good hardware :DDD have fun
>my battery is very good
>complains about battery endlessly
>hi I base everything I do on batterly life
>WHAT THINKPADS HAVE GOOD BATTERY LIFE
I mean my macbook would probably have 20h battery life too if I used nothing but a terminal, chromium and acme'
.g acme rob  pike
anyway I need food ideas
now that sounds good
this shit was probably last updated in kde3
the version number is 2.0.0 but it doesn't pull qt2 so that's a good sign
nope, that's definitely kde2 ported to qt4
the diet helper looks actually decent though
we're talking about a KDE 2 application here
not all at least
I'd like to import recipes from their databse but I'm pretty sure that there is no database anymore
even opera is better than firefox
better than firefox imo
why do you do this to yourself
I really want a tl;dr on naruto's story
I'm curious about the plotline's evolution as the characters grew up
I don't care enough to watch even one episode per season
but I'd read a tl;dr
yeah I watched the first season when I was younger
but apparently he became okage and had a son and shit?
just from the /r/all posts that I've seen
i remember that I found the family with the white eyes cool
oh that was it
but yeah I liked her brother
I do wonder how his personality progressed as time went on
like when the show started it was a shitter but I'm guessing if he became okage he changed a lot?
did naruto die at the end?
idk I only use it on kde
and other good DEs
that let me change it
I know kde handles it by defining a variable in ~/.config/kdeglobals and then passes that shit to qt
but idk how to do it manually
probably in Trolltech.conf or something
I'm going to the store but I have to surive till then
I mean tomorrow I'm going to the storee
that's because it is
I heard someone reference non-binary gender for the first time today
like actually talk about it irl
yeah but that's when you realise it's not just a meme and people actually seriously think there's more than 2 genders
I mean it's not that I care what other people like to identify as to feel special in a world that's constantly trying to convince them that they are even though they aren't and leave them disappointed
it's just that it happens enough that people take it seriously
I'm not special either
NOOO MY ONLY WEAKNESS
they objectively aren't and nobody really cares about them except for a few select people
it says that I chose to be agender to feel like I'm standing out from the two genders
yes that's what I'm arguing
it's all labels anyway
just people trying to find an identity where they shouldn't even look into one
so on that sense I agree that there should be no genders
the fact that sex and gender are separate is already a problem
the fact that gender exists is a problem
it's all from liberal and hollywoodian propaganda
just fueled by capitalism
not really sexist, it's just catholic values bullshit
>a female is soft, sensible and modest
yeah go tell that to some kolkhoznaya in russia
>hi you're soft now
but the left died out in 1945 and couldn't succesfully sprout back
what are you talking about
so you mean socdems and liberals
except for chomsky which is actually nice
idk if you can say that about chomsky
he's pretty fucking objective
but you're talking about neo and pseudo liberals
I think he's often very spot on in his analyses
who doesn't criticize their own country
yeah with VN-5891 getting out of the damn galaxy and shit
I fucking hate this universe
we need active reforms
I just set them in csh.login
unless you do it before startx it's not enough tbh
alright it's serious now
what should I eat
anything that you'd want every program that you launch to inherit
usually locales and shit but your distro handles that for you more often than not
I'm not hungry anymore
man what the fuck
is he eating his fungus and shit?
or like dead skin I guess
no I blacklisted it
it's my 50th filtered sub
lol that cop is only suspended
from the united airlines thing
and people are blaming the cops
this is my life now
except for the posts about cops
>hi we don't realise they're just workers who work for yet another oppressive organisation so they're obviously not human and must be hurt :DDD
that's like blaming the pepsi factory workers for your diabetes
is it any good
well i'll only watch it if you proof watch it for me
I'm going on windows, it's ss13 time again
there's bash on ubuntu on windows you konw
I tried it once
maybe I should eat first actually
better when kwin_wayland is done
it'll be done by 2018 honestly
you're on gnome though
gnome is never going to be ready
you can still use your own wm with kde
no reason to use compiz instead of kwin except if you're weeb
and you never want to be weeb
I'll look at it
but not ghost in the shell
the story doesn't matter when IT'S DEAD
I'm on freebsd right now
I KNEW THAT WAS YOU
wait do you remove your posts right after posting them
I still have a voidlinux flair even though I don't have it installed anymore
it's a shame though
such a good distor
man CDE takes a while to build
it's surprising for something that old
I wish the amdgpu driver on freebsd didn't memleak though
basically everything I'm using right now is git
I wonder if openbsd are even working on drm support
*sigh* memory issues are starting
I do wish I liked gnome though
we've already going for about 2 years haven't we
the gnome desktop is already a thing
man cde takes a while to build
holy shit it must be huge
I haven't tried CDE but it's the only good DE so stop arguing
.yt DSP plays dark souls
the fuck is this
oh that's right I have no sound
and I can't remember how to configure it
time to swear at gnome for a while
I still don't understand how you can like this
what's the gnome irc client again
might as well go full retard
is there sloppy focus in gnome
is there a possibility
I'm right clicking on the clock
it's just showing that horrible menu
>show date show seconds
that's still less option than kde's clock has
what kde's clock isn't huge
you've been doing it wrong then
brb need to polari
I've made a mistake
well it's called polari
holy shit stop notifying me for nickserv messages
do they not realise how bad this looks
there are literally 2 colours
do gnome devs even use irc
I'm starting to believe they don't
what the hell am I doing here
I don't belong here
what the hell am I doing on gnome kill me now
how can you like this
oh god emacs does beeps
stop beeping at me
oh god it beeps when I press a hotkey that I shouldn't on my keyboard
what the rfuck is this weeb
hold on doesn't gnome have a screen recorder
I need to record it
okay that's enough for today
I'm overwriting this with /dev/null
no sloppy focus, it looks l;ike shit, it looks bland as fuck, firefox bars take 1/3rd of my fucking screen, the fucking buttons are huge, it's all fucking blue and dark grey, the only way I can find my window is if I start a really bad looking menu and go through animations, the only way I can find applications is if I go through a really shitty looking menu and animations, notifi
cations cover the whole fucking screen
do I have to keep going
it won't stop beeping at me also
they're all issues that would affect me every day
KDE doesn't get in my way like gnome does
>well, it's bland, I like it
yes you like it
I can't find shit
it's lacking colours or identification for anything
you forgot about the fucking animation that I have to go through so that it opens t he menu and finds my shit and half the time it doesn't even put the right thing at the front
also super is at a fucking awkward spot
who thought super was a good idea
it's a design issue
plus the fact that I can't remap it is a whole new design issue
plus the fact that the desktop runs on fucking javascript of all things
what the fuck is wrong with them
qml is made for this shit
javascript is a generic, shitty, inefficient scripting language
plus not the whole fucking desktop runs on it
I overwrote and reformatted the partition
you like gnome though
whatever I'm browsing /r/prequelmemes for some reason
they just use the same clip over and over
nvi is the only good editor
it's funny how every post in /r/the_donald is starting to look like a trump tweet
it just installs rpmfusion and gives you a menu to install other useful things
what do they do
oh sorry I'm too used to opensuse where you have officially supported 1 click installs for anything important
install it on zfs
I don't really care enough about which version of ssl I'm using
no you don't understand
I barely even know what libressl does and I don't give a fuck
I just know it's encryption-related
 are cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over a computer network
how do you circlejerk about this
I'll go grab my AK
where is the front line comrade
okay yeah continue tomorrow I guess
your ISP sounds like trash
keep in mind you'll probably have to download stuff when you get on it
so you should do that tomorrow I guess
because the first update is always huge
fedora literally never update their fucking live iso
they release it and leave it there until next release so you have to update right when you get on it
and it updates for something like 1-2G
I just understood what your problem is now
anyway I'll see if the ss13 server is up
your torrent should do it
there's an option to test the live cd on the iso
so you'll see at first boot
you'll see it there's an option in grub
you can't miss it
anyway I booted windows for no reason
nah it should wrok with every boot loader
it's an initramfs thing
just make sure you pass the right boot options to your initramfs/kernel
it's all the same for this
what do you think of illumos?
it looks like an interesting project to me but it looks very corporate
idk if corporate is the right word though
wait I thought smartOS was illumos
oh so they're that similar?
yeah I know about pkgsrc though
I tried openindiana but something tells me that's like the TrueOS of illumos
it's interesting how they went the linux way though, just handle the kernel and let others take care of distributing it
I just read the start of your rant about locks
I think some distributions have their own patches?
I know there was something about distribution-specific builds in a section of the wiki
then again I can't use my own kernel on opensuse because of the damn patches
wasn't openbsd a fork?
I'm surprised I haven't heard of that
that was probably only because openbsd wasn't a thing yet
yeah I know that
but the fact that it's done on a hardware level sounds sick
I love ARM thumb mode
>freedom in one organization
TIL Nazis defeated the Nazis
hi weeb we're doing spicy memes
/r/ANI_COMMUNISM isn't active enough
the only good anime sub
and it's not active :(
he got forcefully beaten out of the plane and people are blaming the cops
united airlines also getting shit though which is good
but they'll get away with it and the cops won't
you blame who they work for, not the cops
that's like blaming a factory worker for making the pepsi that gave you diabetes
their order was probably to use force, their training says that to use force means to use force without holding back
giving the orders is no excuse
under orders just means you want to keep your fucking job
they weren't just told to do it, either they did it or they were in that prison with the prisoners
I'm not a class traitor
the world isn't perfect and people don't always do the good thing, especially under a system that always wants them to do bad things for bad people
that's why the system is to blame
if anything you're the class traitor for blaming a worker instead of a multibillion dollar company
yes, that's why you should blame the system they enforce
because they're doing their job to put food on the table
there are bad cops yeah, but you should mostly blame the terrible system for making those cops be able to abuse their power
you need to understand that individuals are meaningless
then you're either very secluded or very short-sighted
why do they get away with it do you think
do you think policemen get into the police force and tell themselves "ah fuck yeah now i can kill some fucking niggers"
they're given monopoly over violence and are told to use it very happily and to be paranoid with it
and some of them are happy to
the issue is that the fucking system lets them abuse their power, and in some cases tells them to
like in the dakota pipeline protests
these people are under order and the orders are "you must be feared"
because you need fucking money to live, do I have to explain the capitalist system to you
you invested a bunch of time and money getting your training
and you're alienated to shits now because the training made you paranoid
of course you won't leave your job
"yeah, I can't do that colonel, you know I really don't feel like these protestors deserver it"
what do you think that'll do
that one cop won't have food in a week and will have to find a new job
still, you have a choice between having a job or being on welfare
even though some of them are assholes they're definitely not to blame, if anything blaming them is a good distraction so that the system isn't touched, it just turns the people against each other
what if every shitstormy news had the people requesting for the legal system within the legal system to change instead of requesting for the cop to be prosecuted
yes, that's the issue
so you have to go higher up and higher up
I'm a syndicalist so I believe the system should be forced to change
if reforms is impossible burn it then ask them again
cops defend the system, the system prevents you from doing it
stop being so short-sighted
of course they don't want you to change it
that's what syndicalism is about
they can't kill all of us
and if they kill even a small part of us that'll just bring up an international outrage and bring other countries on our side
by putting social, economical, productive pressure on the state until they're forced to change it, general strikes, sabotage, threats, blackmail
and don't forget that some cops might be on your side too
so.. they're the ones preventing us from doing it... but we don't need their help?
what are you saying?
you.. don't seem to understand
the power is in numbers
we do want to have them on our side
you know what I'm done
because you're mixing gnome and arch
what do you expect
now when the fuck is funtoo getting 5.9.4
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.9.2 on Funtoo GNU/Linux 2017-02-26 powered by Linux 4.10.8, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4100 MHz, RAM: 4407/7988 MB, Storage: 0/0 GB, 949 procs, 0.84h up
I'm still on 5.9.2 what the fuck
that's in konversation though
I'll have to fix that
nvm it's in os-release

>hi you don't like the FSF so I'm assuming you're a "global heating" denier :^)
I wish coreutils had a decent alternative
busybox really aren't enough for active everyday usue
nice, I didn't know heirloom ran on linux
alright now I really want to make myself a void/musl/heirloom distro that could possibly run on illumos
then again on illumos I could just use the illumos userspace
if I get musl to work on illumos it could be okay
it probably can though
yeah but minix is minix
it's not good at doing much
heirloom has colours enabled by default?
what elon musk created paypal?
alright I hate him now
oh nvm he just created something that merged with something else to make paypal
that's not too bad
I mean he does spacex and tesla
I mean people like elon musk is what the capitalist were thinking of when they thought it'd make the world better
sadly elon musk is a HUGE minority
he's just researching AI to put his brain into HAL
:hal open the pod bay doors
I think he's south african origin
from calgary I think?
so many great people of south african origin from calgary
theo de raadt is also of south african origin from calgary
look at the logo
I was going to buy a new one with the keyboard
but I need to go to the bank first
only if u earn it bby ;)
it's easier to find compatible software for illumos libc than musl though
because illumos is basically sysv4
if I'm not wrong
no reason in getting void if I wanted that
just forking openindiana would do it
and changing the package manager for xbps
also since linux is sysv-like it's probably easier to port drm to illumos
so what did slack do
the thing is, nobody's actually really patching drm code, not major patches anyway
they're just making an interface between the linux code and the freebsd kernel
and their bugfixes are communication issues
a real native drm port would be fucking hard though
turning every linux dependency to their freebsd equivalent
if there are any even
at least with dolphin you can just do what arch did and pull all of kf5 and it's sure to work
the thing is there are so many kf5 frameworks because kde makes an interface for everything to feel like native qt
unless I'm wrong which I'm sure justJanne will tell me very quickly
with gnome they just pull it directly so it's harder to track and you don't have a big meta package for all gnome dependencies
they're all part of kf5 though, I didn't mean it as if they weren't independent
why don't you just use another file manager
you can just remove the fucking clock
you can even replace the damn panel
I love and hate your memes at the same time :(
anyway I need to go to the store
you don't get this on not-/r/all http://i.imgur.com/ARZeF4H.gifv
goddammit I watched it long enough that I can see where it loops
the magic is gone
watch that one anime we found yesterday
hope I don't reach the limit too quickly :(
something like 80% of those are stupid fuckin celebrity subs
that just revolve around a single person/model/actress/etc.
how are there so many fanclubs of a single person that they have subs that reach the fucking front page
I mean shit like this
who the fuck is emilia clarke and why is she on the front page
there's this too https://www.reddit.com/r/RachelCook/
just a few random ones from my filtered subs
because I don't get anything fresh that way
just the shit that I subscribed to
I don't want that
but I don't get the hip new subs then
I have to constantly go on /r/all for anything new
and I would have to actively subscribe to the shitty political subs
I mean it could be uint64_t
or 2000 I guess
.yt night of dreams rolfe dewolfe
oh that's right she deleted her channel :(
no she had a youtube channel with literally only 1 good video and it was great
but she deleted it
why would I download a video made by rolfe
I like this
she had a bunch of videos
they were memes though
idk I ignored them
should I filter /r/trees
not sure why I haven't tbh
look at this shit https://www.reddit.com/r/YanetGarcia/comments/64s5lk/pink/
she's literally just showing her ass
why does she have a fan sub and why is it on /r/all
are there people whose subs are literally just a bunch of subs dedicated to one person?
is this what instagram feels like?
just not instagram diversity
see you don't get this on not-/r/all
I would've never subbed to this
I was only subscribed to /r/wholesomememes and /r/rarepuppers for a while
but then /r/wholesomememes turned to shit
so now I'm only subscribed to /r/rarepuppers
I'm not even kidding
big subs are though
also I filter out subreddits which most content is ads
eh /r/all works fine
I just filter out 1-2 subs a day for some reason
is  there a user script
then I can't use it
there are 2 real browsers and they're both really fucking bad
chromium calls home too much and firefox is insane
also chromium isn't configurable at all
that's an idea though
opera is about as configurable as google
I like opera on windows just because it has features at least
when I talk about google I talk about both chrome and chromium
even though chromium is open source it's still not configurable and it still doesn't callhome
qupzilla and qutebrowser are literally the only good browsers and I'm saying that unironically and regardless of my qt circlejerking
I don't care, if your software needs addons it's already bad
that means it doesn't serve its purpose it's just a catch all
qupzilla and qutebrowser and every webengine-based browsers are fucking great because they have a solid interface, are configurable, serve their purpose while keeping all the features from chromium
qtwebengine is like if webkit was good at the time
and that's fucking great
who gives a shit about your quirks, you could easily port the chrome extension to qupzilla anyway
what do you mean by tree style tabs
you can get it on qupzilla
there's an addon that comes with it called tab manager
same as chromium
userscripts exist, qutebrowser exists
idc about those though I just wanna browse the fucking web
and get decent html5 support
I don't want to be prompted every window because facebook.com is present somewhere
why the fuck would you want that
you can disable the tab bar though
stallman masturbates to GPLv3 and creates a new version when the current licence doesn't do it anymore
he usually responds to his emails
you could message him and he'll respond
i doubt that many people message him every day though
it's probably mostly mailing lists
last time I did this he just replied saying that people who don't like the FSF are similar to "global heating" deniers
>mcafee is a bro
yeah having a rich cunt who only parties and doesn't give a fuck about anyone as president is definitely a good idea
that doesn't make it any better
sanders was the only decent candidate
I don't mind him golfing
better than trying to be president
american politics were doomed since WW1
when they started to be 90% propaganda wars
hoping sanders gets elected in 2020
he might actually be stupid enought o
>if this racist dumass can do it surely I can!
yes you still have that ANI_COMMUNISM one
I can already hear the beeps
sorry I have PTSD
ask weeb I can't think about it anymore
please stop beeping at me
I can feel your gnome from here
anyway pizzaiolo I like to have more than 2 colours on my irc client
I do wish I liked gnome though
It would make my life so much easier
I could just live on redhatware
not caring about anything
I'll be your clock
you can use me senpai
I'll be like one of those mickey mouse clocks except my right hand will be the seconds, my left will be the minutes and my dick will be the hours
I am very flacid at 6 o'clock
I feel like this meme is sometimes ironic sometimes now
it makes no sense
this is one meme I don't get
the prequel memes are spicy as hell though
and I don't even like star wars
it's pretty bad imo
the original one was okay
maybe you could run it through gdb
I only know on freebsd where shit makes sense
I wonder if I could make a userscript that could force every textbox to use readline
by forcing every textbox to use readline I mean every textbox, gtk browsers don't do that either
if I do ctrl+u on chrome or firefox it doesn't delete the text, it opens the source
except for the address bar on firefox
no I'm not I've tried it
what doesn't open source
it does on chromium I can't remember what it does in firefox
I know it doesn't do what I expect it to though I've tried
anyway firefox is horrible
if I used a gtk browser it'd be chromium
its name is the worst part actually
I bought the trackball
but I pussied out of buying what I needed to replace the switches on my keyboard
and I have a risk of completely fucking up the keyboard
and that's 100 USD, that's like 50 billion dollars in kanadstan
went well, I need to learn to use it though
you fucked up partitioning
or you selected the wrong hdd
keyboards suck anyway
what's a special snowflake alternative to keyboards
is that your windows partition
do you want to keep it
you'll end up writing it from scratch?
what about that matias one though, it's cheap enough I guess
what's the idea behind it
then delete everything
so the same way I can do everything torvalds does, I just don't?
or like it supports the features but it's not implemented at all
the filesystem you're writing?
oh so you're cloning an old concept
I'm on zfs right now <3
I just made a script that fetches a zfs and spl release and patch my kernel
just have to run it before building
yeah I noticed that it takes up a lot of ram
feature-wise it's nice though
haven't really looked at the code
old things are weird
:hal open the pod bay doors
wait it said weeb when you did this weeb
did tsahyt hardcode it?
:hal opene the pod bay doors
:hal what the fuck
maybe tsahyt wasn't kidding when he said his bot was sentient
:hal please call me weabot
oh there we go
so tsahyt DID hardcode it?
yes, that's why you should switch to #bsdmasterrace
where everything is better but empty
just admit it you don't know how to make chocolate parfaits
the plasma theme is really nice on fedora imo
was just trying it out, I like the concept of pools though, and copy on write is always good
I personally don't like it
zfs pools are so much better than that imo
fedora's base theme is very good, just change the colour scheme and you're set
unless you don't like breeze
I mean you get what you pay for don't you
that's why I program in microsoft word
> (weabot) [7/79] <weabot> * weabot leaves with his nice vagina
yes but at least we know they suck
>i base my opinion on other people's opinions
whatever I'm gonna go take a shit
I don't think it only supports ubuntu officially, it just pretends to so that it doesn't have to give customer support to non-ubuntu users
but there's a steam helper script or something that worked with zypper
that would install dependencies
from the opensuse repos
so they are actually working for steam to be usable on more than ubuntu
isn't that just steam with a different environment variable set in the .desktop file and/or starting script?
aren't they just basic libraries though?
although 32 bit unless that changed
what mine work fine out of the box on fedora and opensuse
haven't tried other distros though
didn't work with AMD
try a qtwebengine-based browser
qtwebengine is qt-embedded chromium, qupzilla and qutebrowser are more configurable interfaces to it
you should try it to see if one of these browsers are your thing, you'll get the same performance as chromium with a different interface
sudo dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/windowspartition bs=4K
I mean you don't want your zeroes do be disordered do you ;)
you should try qtwebengine though
oh wait are you on windows right now?
I mean qupzilla works on windows, otherwise there's opera that I really like on windows
it's not like you really care about proprietary software if you're on windows
eh I never got into overwatch
tried it in the beta and it sucked
everybody should invest in dead meme currency
are you on libinput
looks like a missing dependency
no I think it'd probably be a kf5 package
if there's a meta package sure, kf5 is just a group of packages though
actually it might be a qt packages
yeah I told you
they never update their ISO so you have to run an update right after installing
I mean they're fucking partnered by redhat they could so easily automatically update it
but they don't because fuck you
you should go ask in #kde on freenode what the missing dependency is
no it's a dependency issue
not a version issue
it would be pretty fucking bad if the release needs to be fixed
try installing kcmutils
you should have that though
it's probably something like libkde-kf5-kcm-IDJUSTLIKETOINTERJECTFORAMOMENT-gnu-utils-devel-nodebug
or whatever these fucking distros name their shit
the most retarded is ubuntu though
meh, not as far as kf5 goes at least
I tried to build a kde apps package once on ubuntu, I had something like 5 kf5 dependencies to install manually but I couldn't make sense of the naming scheme enough to type a single one without doing apt search first
well it was kde neon
but kde neon follows the ubuntu naming scheme
it's really not just that
they merge, mix, pick different packages, add random suffixes and prefixes, sometimes put the -dev, somtimes don't
there's actually no constant fucking naming scheme for kf5
nah devel isn't the same
you only need it if you're building from source as far as I know
holy fuck I'm so fucking bored
I need a project
what project though that's the issue
all those I like would require me to learn C++. qt and kde
3 huge fucking libraries
meh I don't really care about minecraft/test
I played it once, punched a bunch of pigs, dug to the center of the earth, found diamond, "this is what the hype is about? they're so fucking easy to find" roamed around a bit, killed shit, got bored, uninstalled
when I played minetest I made a sex cave though
yeah I just don't care about it
maybe I should learn C++/qt/kde
I tried a few times
just refresh until it's good
that should be representative of the features intended to ship with the
final release expected on April 13th, 2017.
that guy who makes linux sucks talked about it once
sometimes I wake up and ask myself "why am I not on opensuse"
then I remember that opensuse's kernel is heavily patched and I couldn't use mine so I also couldn't install it on zfs
and then I cry myself back to sleep
basically just some guy talking at a convention, he always starts by bashing on linux talking about the bad parts then in the second half he talks about the same thing but good parts
it's very circlejerky though
eh it's literally impossible not to use spyware unless you're on a 5000$ IBM POWER8 machine
there's proprietary firmware in all your hardware and who the fuck knows what it's doing
no the firmware is literally IN your hardware
even your CPU has proprietary firmware
even before you installed an OS on your computer
that's why I talked about POWER8, POWER8 is open
pretty sure sparc is open too
but who the fuck uses sparc anymore
man templeos looks so fucked up
it really shows that it's made by someone with schizophrenia
I found this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozTndb7DaFg
holy shit he just said the purpose of the universe is to entertain god
then god likes soap operas
>the difference between a professional and amateur operating system is writing a compiler
tigerfixes he actually uses ubuntu
he fucks around on his OS but he uses ubuntu as his daily driver
that's what it looks like anyway
this guy's actually fucking scary
I'm getting my trackball tomorrow
why am I watching terry davis compilations
what am I doing with my life
oh man he thinks he's playing chess against god
I hate when distributions put every script until /bin/sh expecting it to support bashisms
I find it a bit sad
more than a bit actually
that'd be a lie
mental health issues are such a scary thing
gentoo/kfreebsd still uses glibc and coreutils though
weeb was thinking of doing that with void but heirloom's not compatible with musl
weeb I'd need to use uClibc I think
not ready to port a new library to void though, I'd rather just port the whole thing to illumos kernel and libc
also hi void <3
tigerfixes not without ruining the damn purpose
I wonder how compatible freebsd libc is with linux given that libbsd exists
weeb void is so bad though in the sense that while it could potentially be easily de-GNUable™ it's also entirely built on bash scripts
which is fucking stupid
did he call him CIA
weeb he said in a video I watched earlier "the difference between an amateur OS and a professional OS is that you made the compiler"
weeb he said that while using ubuntu
AB49K linus wrote his compiler in the early days, it just wasn't very advanced and he had no reason not to switch to gcc
what the fuck is gnome os
gnome... is an operating system?
when will gnu subprojects stop redefining what an operating system is
>hi we can't build a good os so what we did IS the OS now :^)
fly I forgot whether you were brushing up old code or writing it from scratch
Materiyolo did you try to install something manually
fly yeah it's kf5
weeb stop it's not funny anymore
Materiyolo you'll need to at least update all of kde I think, you installed something that expects a newer version
it'd just be more documented
shouldn't be too big
isn't seabios what you want if you want to use coreboot?
or is it the other way aroudn
also why do we have like 15 ircops in this channel
weeb I can't wait to try this trackball
I'll either really love it or ask for a refund
it can't be in between
but I think I'll like it since I really like trackpads
like more than a mouse for most purposes
i fucking hate clitmice though
never could stand using one
apple trackpads on macOS are really fucking hard to be though
tigerfixes eh I'm not talking about a magic mouse
I'm talking about trackpads
yeah they kind of do
it's not precise, takes more room and it's not really comfortable
idk that yet but not more than a trackpad
it's good for shit where you need to do fast movements though
no clit mouse is the worse imo
weeb I didn't like how the slimblade went at it though, the profile seems better but the way it scrolls, the damn clicky buttons, the laser things, etc.
I prefer a mechanical one with real buttons and a real scrollwheel
don't worry I looked into it ;)
eh I'd rather just drag my finger around
than to actually turn the damn ball
which one is the question
ask in #kde on freenode
they know for sure
well there it is
install the synaptics driver
Model: MacBook Pro (13-inch, Early/Late 2011) • OS: macOS Sierra (Version 10.12.4, Build 16E195)
you need to update the whole thing....
daily bandwidth limits are evil
I'm glad I don't have a limit at all
TuxFuk they didn't for the same reason the US didn't use nuclear bombs during the cold war
I mean taking the side of the nazis on anything is worth being avoided...
well defending someone who did is also fucked and it's hard to say anything with the huge political divide in the US
the only good palce to be is on neither side
or just pretend to be on both sides until you get called out and then both sides hate you
who cares if you were an asshole or not
don't talk about touchy subjects, they're all mass media-fueled reactionary shit anyway
that's american politics in a nutshell
Materiyolo if you're going to run an upgrade you need to do the full thing
half your libraries are broken
even with pacman that'll still break your libraries
you've just been lucky
it's so stupid though, why does fedora not update their damn CDs
all it would take is a buildserver that runs a script once a week or something
they wouldn't even need to build it just dnf update in the live iso environment, recompress it and ship it
keep a few of the later versions to give a fallback in case one's broken and it's done
these cunts are partnered with redhat how is this so hard to do
I feel like there's none, they just put all the work on the release itself but none on the distribution
weeb please stop beeping at me
I just smell it
you're installing gnome aren't you
I can hear the beeps
for every byte a new beep
on gnome binary isn't 1 and 0 it's beep and nobeep
and gnome is all 1's
if you want to get gnome running on anything just fill about 1G on your filesystem with f's
every f represents 16 beeps :(
weeb look what you've done to me
I do wish I liked it though
it'd also be easier to contribute to since it's C
it's on wayland and as flawlessly as gnome is, so with many flaws but they're gnome issues
it has so much redhatware which makes life easier
it's easier to get the big browsers to follow any kind of uniformity rules, as much as gtk will let you
which is pretty much null
plus because of gnu, redhat and freedesktop it is some sort of standard
but goddamn does it suck
in every way possible, no configuration, barely any modularity, you have to hack at javascript to get out of any of their rules, you just NEED to extend it which is flawed in and of itself, and the extensions are javascript scripts, it won't stop beeping at me, the actual design of their applications is fucking horrible, nothing is integratable except for the shitty fucking gnome software
but then you won't have any form of integration
it's impossible for anything that's not gnome to integrate into gnome
also it fucking loves to let CSD do their thing
which is a whole new issue
I don't even know what these are
Materiyolo go grab a coffee and relax then
that's why I fucking hate gnome
no good software integrate well into it
although for the multimedia player there is a gnome mpv interface iirc
I'm so spoiled with plasma giving me exactly what I want
why the hell would I want gnome
I like the kde clock :(
TuxFuk that'll turn off most women
that way your girlfriend would know you could never cheat on her
yeah mpv is the best
the interfaces are very good too
and it runs natively on wayland
weeb yeah there are no decorations on wayland
dragon player does the job
weeb there were none on plasma wayland either
because wayland loves CSDs
clementine can do that too iirc can't it?
i haven't used clementine in a while though
cantata is pretty good
weeb if you uncheck gnome but keep debian desktop environment checked it'll install gnome
cat file.mp3 | /dev/audio and pretend it plays the actual song
it will make an evil song
and probably break your headphones
although it'd be nice to make an audiocat or something
just have a bunch of built-in decoders
and it decodes it to raw audio
which you can pipe to anything
justJanne pretty much the same for me
I remember useless shit that I've been told years ago
I'd rather just memorize how to decode mp3 files manually and echo the bits to /dev/audio myself
one at a time
justJanne well I should open it up and modify it to have a 1 byte buffer
either you play sound or you don't
the sound should be random
I'd rather cat urandom tbh
when I'm on linux i mena
anyway I need to sleep
just had a nice nap and now I'm about ready to fuck some bitches and contribute to foss
== means "I don't understand programming on a basic level so I think I can make a mathematical statement using conditionals"
it's a condition tester
the proper mathematical syntax for an equality is x = y
but it still doesn't imply an equality which is how it was incorrectly used
what I'm saying is the proper mathematical statement for an equality is "x = y"
regardless of the technical detail == doesn't mean anything
in speech at least
I understand how assertions work I just don't know all the lingo
I don't fucking care holy shit
I fucking know that == is compiled into a comparison instruction that will be used to branch the flow
that doesn't fucking matter in my statement though
you're just playing on words
I'm so salty actually
I don't know the fucking correct terminus I learned assembly by reading a fucking book in my underwear
but I know you're kidding, but idk if pb was trolling but that's just the most frustrating shit ever
I know assembly though, I just don't obsess about the fucking terminology pb
don't be a smartass the fact that == branches from a compare instruction instead of JZ doesn't even matter in my first statement
whatever I'm still more rested than you so I win
I just had a nice nap
oh god please don't talk shit about slackware
he didn't mean it I promise
if he's not responding he's probably not at his computer but he probably just started running at high speed towards the nearest computer right now to REEEE all over pb
come to #bsdmasterrace I'll protect you form Zowlyfon's mod abuse
wait Zowlyfon is anyone talking shit?
if you aint into boipussy you're no friend of mine
o shit is this the time
isn't infinality deprecated already?
I thought it was
I agree though, funtoo's better
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.9.2 on Funtoo Linux 2017-02-26 powered by Linux 4.10.8, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4099 MHz, RAM: 7896/7988 MB, Storage: 0/0 GB, 969 procs, 1.68h up
I use my own kernel though
it works really well
when I first got it it really only worked on fedora
now it works out of the box on any distro that ships a kernel with amdgpu enabled
which is anything >4.2
like you don't need xorg drivers or anything
xorg drivers are for configuration
they're both based on drm
I really need to find a project to get into
I didn't know that
it's probably just a japan thing
did you run the update
so everything's still borked?
nvm it's at 4.10.10 now
change those konversation colours man
my colour scheme is obsidian coast, you can change the chat's colours manually
he has like 800M a day in bandwidth cap because he lives in a shithole
and fedora don't bother updating their fucking live CDs so there's always like a 2G update at first boot
it's 1-2G in my experience
do `cat /sbin/systemd > /dev/dsp` and tell me how that goes please
I don't have systemd
you don't have systemd?
or do you not have read access to /sbin?
wait do you have /dev/dsp?
it's the sound device usually
probably because of pulseaudio i guess
of course there is
I'm catting random binaries do /dev/dsp
that way you can hear the binaries
well how your sound device interprets the binaries I guess
doing very productive research I see
or by AMD PR employees
everybody uses anime girls for marketing in japan
I don't think WinterFox is a weeb
he's just a furry
don't make WW2 jokes they're not funny man it let the superpowers settle and led to the really shitty political situation of today
eh who gives a shit about japan
they'll die off in a century and will be taken over by china
doesn't surprise me much
china has such a dense population it's hard for any other mammal to compete
but it's not like anyone in india can migrate anywhere
the populated parts of china are
I wouldn't say only beijing is overpopulated though
they have a lot of overpopulated cities
they're doing the exact same thing in Vancouver, Canada
chinese investors are buying a bunch of condos and houses and leaving them empty
it's actually a problem
china interests me a lot
not planning a trip anytime soon though
anyway I'd like to get into kernel development/hacking but idk where to start
only thing that scares me in china is the air pollution
I mean I can't read the damn article but I'll trust them on that I guess...
without knowing any sources or information whatsoever
so that "polish city" is actually "polish capital"
I hate air pollution though
I live in a 500k people city and there's a factory at like 5km from my home and I can smell heavy metals in the air on days where the wind blows in the wrong direction
but that's nothing compared to those kinds of cities
I'm glad they're planning on replacing coal
doesn't surprise me much
eh, the nuclear scare is overdone, you just need tighter regulations and to make sure that literally nothing can go wrong
with robotics and technology it's much easier to take into account human error than it was before
that was a bit dumb
but japan should just stop nuclear plants though, don't make fucking nuclear power plants where earthquakes are common please
no that was microsoft
which browser do you think is more portable: chromium or firefox?
of course but what about the 2 big ones
chromium seems to work better on musl though, I wonder if it's just because the void guys worked more on that than firefox
anyway idk why I'm doing this I need to sleep
I wonder if phamaceuticals could sue the news for unjustifyingly degrading what they sell
>as producers of chemical blah blah blah
why did I click this
most people who were around back then do remember newgrounds
and flash animations are still there
flash animations are fun sometimes
well, purolator is closed because of easter
I'll have to wait until monday or tuesday to get it
these cunts fucking gave me a pickup ticket without ringing the fucking bell and closed right after
I was literally there waiting for them and then I got an email like "hey you missed delivery 5 minutes ago"
I WAS RIGHT THERE
it's the last fuckin time I get shit delivered by purolator
I'll fucking pay a website to avoid purolator
canada post never did this
I should complain until the manager comes and gives me the parcel in person
either that or they block my number and send it back to amazon
#bsdmasterrace would make this meme better
I made a void install where I removed bash and symlinked /bin/bash to /bin/zsh
it broke xbps-src but otherwise it's good
also replaced gawk with nawk
because I'm trying to make a gnu-less void setup
is it more compatible with gawk?
void is written for gawk
well runit uses gawk
now I need to port heirloom to musl
and I don't have a trackball
I might fix xbps-src to work with zsh but it's a lot of work
actually maybe I could try to use it with dash
there are variable issues
./xbps-src:564: read-only variable: XBPS_SHUTILSDIR
I just replaced export by setenv and it worked
thank the csh gods
./xbps-src:564: command not found: setenv
they're all defined as readonly
I should just rewrite xbps-src in perl
seriously though, bash is horribly misused
yes but shells shouldn't be used as that kind of scripting language imo this is stupid
when your whole fucking OS depends on it no, it's not nice
it's the laziest, most inefficient shit in the world
shells should be used for conditionally executing binaries and to manage environment variables or setting runtime environment
it absolutely shouldn't be used as its own program
idk never looked into that
I'm talking about shell scripts like xbps-src
where the whole fucking program is a huge shell script
any half decent actual scripting language would be better
shell languages aren't meant for that
that's what I'm proposing too
anyway I was going to port heirloom-tools to xbps but I guess I'd need bash to do that wouldn't I?
too bad for them
I got rid of coreutils
I should since it relies on yacc
but I'd use sysvinit instead
I'll check it out
that'd be a huge pain in the ass for no reason though
I'm working on the devutils right now
I just redid what I removed earlier
they're trying to turn a char* to an int though, what's wrong with them
and then they're passing it to sprintf
it's taken as an argument as char* and they use it in a local function as int, and they pass it to that function with (int) variable
it makes nos ense
yeah but this is from the original unix dev utilities from heirloom
I just turned the ints back to chars and it compiled
if it compiles it works ;)
no more glibc or coreutils <3
now let's see how much shit that fucked up
runit relies on GNUware too much, it panics and kills itself shutting down the system
I'll have to switch to s6 I guess
>hi we made a good distro and we want to be BSD-like but we based the whole thing on GNUware hacks, good luck!
you're not a real man unless you program in machine code
you're new hop of #bsdmasterrace, we're one spot free now

> (weabot) [17/79] <weabot> I've never been so sexually attracted to a computer
IS THIS THE TIME?!
so konversation crashed twice today but the moment I open it in terminal to see the damn logs it doesn't crash for an hour
it's probably related to dbus tbh it's always related to dbus
This is still wrong...
>I settle for mediocrity
I can only imagine
what was the anime but not anime?
an official world republic programming language that's basically your dream language?
make him president of the united americas
you mean using sed?
finally there it is
Attempting to start /usr/lib64/libexec/drkonqi from kdeinit
I think I have it
nvm I just have the library I guess?
stop beeping at me please
I ran it in gdb insteadd
that's not an actual newline
that's just a cut so that it doesn't go off the terminal
it's not an actual character in the file
it's not an actual character either though
oh in stocks not in marketshare
I use opera on windows
whenever I'm on windows
I've been using it for a year though
but only when I use windows
more than a year actually
KDE is the essential
no seriously, if you're new to linux and want a riced desktop KDE is your best bet, otherwise have fun fucking around with gtk
you'll run back to windows once you discover CSD
that's why you don't use gtk
except, you know, you have a customizable, stable, modular desktop.. On a unix system...
wait how is it like windows again?
stop it it's not funny anymore
look what you've done
the first thing you'll learn is that the linux community is very divided, and everybody will tell you different things
for now install opensuse with plasma 5
yes, if there's one thing we agree on
the sub has a different opinion though
that's just because of lazy packaging
basically the arch maintainers are lazy as fuck, and that's why you shouldn't use it
show us a unixporn post that you like, I'll say KDE
I like my funtoo gtk-less install on zfs with my own minimal hardened kernel
its purpose is to be an easy distro to maintain, it doesn't have a purpose for the user
I do miss opensuse most of the time though
I just wish I could easily have what I have on funtoo with opensuse
mostly zfs and qupzilla, also opensuse doesn't let me use my own kernel
I don't really care about no gtk
it does, it doesn't package it right, and I tried to fix it before switching from it I ended up borking the whole qt install
not really, it's just that I updated to the testing repo, then back to the stable repo
and it was kind of stuck between both in a very incompatible manner
are you on xwayland?
well the qt clients
anyhow qt support is still experimental on wayland
wayland support is experimental on qt
that's a better way to say it
did this guy turn i3 into a floating wm
it really sounds like you want gnome/gtk but here's mine if you're interested https://u.teknik.io/JuqMJ.png
I had to use sudo for screenfetch because screenfetch isn't compatible with heirloom awk :(
nothing to start a war like asking for distro/DE recommendation
that's how WW3 will start
>hey guys I think ubuntu Kylin sucks
NI HAO YOU WHAT MATE
IM GON BOMB THE SHIT OUTTA YOU
honestly if you want something easy to customize and stable use KDE
do you want things to be stable or new
antergos is arch, arch isn't good
that's the consensus here
answer this: stable or new?
that's the same on everything, it only depends on your desktop environment
distros have different ways to distribute packages which make your environment, they themselves have nothing to do with what you get except for what they give by default
you can get the same looking stuff on any distros if the packages have the same version
arch is absolutely not stable and absolutely doesn't "just work"
packages versions, maintainer choices, different ways to distribute software mostly
different priorities, different decisions
pretty much just depends on what you need
if you try to use a theme that's not adwaita, numix or arc you'll get fucked by the latest gtk3
oh you mean the gnome shell javascript interface?
where everything's fucking javascript
just use netbsd with CDE
do you care about p roprietary software
just not the default one with unity
it's going to be deprecated soon anyway
so now's the time to choose your DE
from what you've said it sounds like you either want KDE, xfce or gnome, gnome would be the least configurable but best supported, xfce is outdated and KDE is customizable but gets fucked by gnome software
for kde: neon.kde.org gnome: http://ubuntugnome.org/
it only looks good
no, Kubuntu is on plasma 5.5
KDE neon ships 16.04 on plasma 5.8 LTS
with a bunch of bugfixes above 5.5
Kubuntu is fucking horrible and should just die
90% of the posts asking for help in #kde are from kubuntu users about bugs that were already fixed
use CDE on netbsd
and become a unix god
as a new user just using ubuntu would save you a lot of trouble just because you'll ignore everything underneath it
so it doesn't matter otherwise
and ubuntu ships with proprietary shit
use kde neon tbh
my real first was opensuse a huge while ago
you're on vesa
you say this using gnome?
have fun I guess
I'm getting my trackball tomorrow
I wonder if I'd have a better experience on gnome if I tried it on opensuse
still if I used opensuse why the fuck would I use gnome with it
wine sucks though
why do you even care about it
just use that hybrid gpu of yours to make a pci passthrough vm
it still has a pci address right?
everything being blurry makes me feel like I'm using gnome
so both Putin and NATO are against him but he still has the power to do this kind of shit?
if he has trump on his side it doesn't matter tbh
that's an unfair comparison though
asad has a powerful ally but basically no power in his country, Kim has no allies but full power in his country
Erdogan has very powerful allies (NATO) and full power in his country
he's still a part of it isn't he
according to the deal they're bound to be allies
I'm using quassel now just because I'm too lazy to compile a version of konversation that I can fallback to
an update on funtoo just broke it though
and I don't feel like debugging it right now so I just sent a bug report
can you give me a useful like to find out how to set it up?
yeah I'm connected to quasselcore
just both from the same computer
I need a new microSD for my raspberry pi though
then I'll host quasselcore on it
I'll try it once I get that microSD
it should arrive this week
wish that were true for dbus :(
that shitty soda company's viral marketing is working
man I am so ashamed of this world
I want a new one
monolithic or with core/client?
can confirm she used them on me once
I'm sure you even have it on a binding
not that I care anyway I really only play space station 13
bsd gaming is a thing though if you can call it that
the PS4 OS is based on freebsd <3
pretty sure the switch is based on freebsd too no?
why? is that bad? you think if freebsd existed PS4 and switch would use linux?
they'd just make their own OS and it'd be shitty
now at least they're relying on freebsd to keep their shit together
then nobody would fucking use it
by nobody I mean no enterprises
how is that a good thing
no they wouldn't, they'd just spend the money that they would otherwise contribute to freebsd into their own fucking operating system
and it'd be really shitty
so as it is now, freebsd gets something out of it and the PS4 gets something out of it
closing that connection brings no good to anybody
because PS4 would be more expensive and it would still be close
the kurds have a lot of hope
they are also at war against Turkey
Turkey is at war against them at least
these kinds of genocides are often because of western-backed nationalism during the cold war :/
that's wrong though
GNU has nothing to do with the operating system
you should only use Linux
ideology should stay out of operating systems
no it's not
the GNU tools are not a part of the operating system
look at the definition above
the GNU coreutils and glibc are only part of the applications that make use of the operating system, according to the definition
the operating system is linux and the modules and firmware that use it
what I wanted to say before this is
weechat is usable with quassel core
oh is there a new kde apps update?
oh that's right, it's 17.03.90 the 90 kind of implies beta
glad it does, noticed anything new?
I haven't tried unstable KDE in a while
I'm going to download neon devedition
I removed it for some reason the other day
nono just for testing
not as a main OS ;)
I know what I'm getting into don't worry
I'm curious about the state of wayland
was talking about wayland on KDE berkiyo
they're also making a lot of progress
they're about at the same point where wayland on gnome was a year ago
when I tried it
I'd say that gnome on wayland is ready
most gnome distributions have it on by default
qt5 often isn't packaged properly for wayland, qt4 and gtk2 rely on xwayland and are buggy
some applications that weren't meant for wayland may crash
I haven't tried it on gnome but games don't work well on KDE wayland because the global hotkeys aren't ignored, that's easy to resolve though
just have an option to turn off global hotkeys in full screen windows
I played Kmahjongg once on kwin_wayland
it was in xwayland though
have you seen KDE's updated site?
they reworked a few things and made documentation more accessible
those extensions are in javascript, that would explain why they make things more laggy
javascript really isn't meant to be relied on for this kind of thing
stable release should be soon :D
I've been using qupzilla, it does the job well, it's as performant as chromium and it integrates well
yes, it's chromium with a qt interface
it supports everything chromium does
>Browser integration in Plasma will be improved by integrating notifications and download progress and multimedia natively into Plasma by providing a browser extension that relays this information to the Plasma shell.
now I can't wait for plasma 5.10
the issue with gtk and qt is that gtk doesn't listen to your colour scheme, which is always an issue
you'll have to edit the breeze gtk theme to your colour scheme specifically to get some level of integration
and it's never perfect
but I don't use gtk at all now
what should it do?
it does it for me...
you're never sure on arch
no, there are more settings
qupzilla implements chromium as some sort of engine, it uses its own stuff for spell checking, history, cookies, and can configure html5 and all
what is it
I haven't noticed it
probably because I don't have that habit
it's probably because of qt
since the interface is handled by modules
epiphany is webkit though
it doesn't support doing much
it's as outdated as konqueror
the UI looks a lot like safari though
one of my biggest issues with quassel is that it doesn't use QString.readLine() for line editing which makes it a bit inconsistent with the rest of qt
yeah that's what I did too
okular is very good
this is why I like okular
you can change the bright and the dark colours to whatever you want
it's good for black/white but it breaks coloured images
but it makes everything so much easier to read
but it's not qt
I use that colour scheme everywhere
there's a redshift widget
it's just a redshift interface, you can change the screen colour by scrolling the mouse wheel over it
I use the regular breeze theme with a colourscheme
the only thing I do when I get to a new kde desktop is change the colour scheme, change the buttons in the title bar, rearrange the panels a bit, set a few hotkeys and window management rules and I'm good
I don't change very much in terms of interface
sloppy focus, raise on hover, etc.
don't listen to weeb he's on the fedora beta
he's on 26
latest is 25 though isn't it
also melmeiro did you know that you can give each window or each window of a certain application specific settings?
say you always want okular to be transparent with no decorations and a few weird things, you can set that in the application-specific kwin settings and every instance of it will follow those rules
you're on ryzen?
they promised that htey'd consider it
WPS office is good apparently
so systemd's remove command doesn't forbit to remove . or ..
The rm utility is forbidden to remove the names dot and dot-dot
that's the standard unix utility
why have they not taken it from that
￼ poettering locked and limited conversation to collaborators 5 hours ago
except openRC doesn't have a remove command
rm is from the coreutils not openrc
if you weren't gentoo wouldn't boot, unless you're just not using them on your user like I do
openssl won't have you remove the upper directory if you want to remove all dotfiles in a directory
remember when systemd would erase your uefi
it'll have its place as long as systemd exists
no reason to implement its own cron either
a?b:c; is better imo
but as a choice I prefer the first one
you're all wrong anyway
machine code is the only good programming language after ARM Thumb Mode
arm thumb mode machine code is orgasmic though
think of it this way https://paste.kde.org/pztridoty
also you can legally add an else in there
because else is always true
that's what it would result in
and here we're close to if a then b else c except without too much redundency and more verbose
as to what exactly happens in there
you should do it in your garage
just wear a disguise
contribute to FOSS there
the only issue with this syntax though is stacking else ifs
(if a b (if c d (if e f g)))
we're at 4.11 rc7, next sunday 4.11 releases if everything goes well <3
most  qt5 application should work absolutely fine under wayland if they were packaged properly
if your distro are using them under xwayland and ships wayland by default they're the retarded ones
I've used kwin_wayland and most things on it works natively on wayland without issue
that's a packaging issue then
unless it's a documented issue there's no way it would run fine under wayland on 5.7 but not on 5.8
it's a packaging issue though, don't try to blame that shit on qt, wayland has been supported since 5.4 and it's more than mature enough to not have the kinds of drastic changes that would break it
fedora probably fucked up dependencies
so dealing with rms?
I mean rms keeps saying he doesn't like proprietary software because he doesn't understand it
I can't study the code or whatever
anyway I'm trying that amdgpu dal kernel that linux didn't merge
the foss community doesn't care about stupid social media apps
only when it's not me
I'm on the DAL kernel
I'm about to check out what my framerate looks like on CSGO with it
I really only start up csgo to test graphics updates anymore
eh, no real framerate difference
my HDMI monitor's gamma is lower than usual though for some reason
how can you expect something not evil to fight for power
I'm using a trackball
the fuck is gdc
I mean I guess I'm a game dev then
I'm gonna make a revolutionary gay space communist sci-fi third person role playing game
you're still talking about my dream gay communist sci-fi?
make sure there's a luscious sex scene in front of a giant window overlooking space
a gay sex scene of course
and the window gets all steamy
and the two guys are all sweaty
will you make all the voices
can you just make a 15 seconds sex scene as I described
the best half year of your life
the other one has to tear it off before the sex though
isn't npm javascript bullshit
since when ar eopenbsd release songs bad taste?
a fat guy that's trying to fit under an arch
I thought I used that once
yea not at all
you want either a BSD or fedora on laptops I think
the fuck you mean by opensuse is shit
what zypper is the best binary package manager
actually nothing beats in in functionality, speed and clarity
how can you claim zypper's bad?
dnf is slow as fuck though
zypper in package
how is that bad
it beats apt and dnf
apt's output is fucking disgusting and the commands make no sense
not at all, and pacman lacks so many things
>hi I can't backroll and update unless I have the last packages in cache :DDDDD
emerge isn't the same
eh just use noto everywhere
so this girl is saying that she thinks that if a guy beats his girlfriend it's because he loves her...
anyway you should use nvi
you don't need a .vimrc on nvi
because it's not trash
ed is mostly used in scripting via sed nowadays
that would be vi
vi is pretty much an ed GUI
no sam is just ed except retarded
I weigh like 80kg now
does suicide linux work if you're not on bash
that's just speculation though, how does it actually rm -rf /
how is the shell script called
it's most likely in the shell rc, which means that it only works on bash or bash-compatible shells
so if I use tcsh, it won't do rm -rf /
unless it has it in cshrc
this channel's shit anyway your sed command is worthless here
no it's not gonzo
seriously though, zsh on its own is fucking unusable and I always think if you need plugins, extensions or a 500 line config file to use it, it's badly designed anyway
on tcsh I just set a few environment variables and I'm done
I set about 2-3 for usability and about 10 for comfort in my tcshrc
keep in mind that I like my stuff minimal and that some things there are enabled by default but I still explicitly enabled https://github.com/weabot/configs/blob/master/tcshrc
At its core, oh is a heavily modified dialect of the Scheme programming language, complete with first-class continuations and proper tail recursion
man fuck heat
anything above 10 degrees celsius is too hot
it's [-3,2] degrees here
I mean if you choose cold vs warm it's obvious
when it's cold you can just put on more clothes but what the fuck do you do when it's warm
tear off your skin?
or just a troll
export DRI_PRIME=1 && screenfetch if your on a badshell
or setenv DRI_PRIME && screenfetch
check out gnome recipes you'll love it
there are wonderful things in there such as pizzaburger and a potato recipe where it's just 5 potatoes under a sauce that's 1 whole stick of butter and cream cheese
no I mean to laugh at the americans trying to cook
not to get recipes
gnome recipe is actually decent though
most of them are shit
but gnome recipes is nice
look at the picture though
>5 potatoes (5 cans sliced potatoes), 1 stick of butter, 1 pouch of cream cheese, some spice
eh I like kde better, I only come on gnome to meme
and because weeb convinced me to try it
but only the default install is windowsy because it's made to be familiar to windows users, it can be literally anything
KDE on opensuse is the best
and why the fuck doesn't polari use readline
DNA of the soul :(
look at that fucking UI
you can barely distinguish different posts
yast is great though
but you don't rely on it in any way after the initial installation
and it's very useful
anyway back to KDE
I am warming up to gnome a bit but I would never use it as my daily driver
I got a lot of things out of that
but a taco recipe isn't one of them
I mean I learned that if you want to make a potato sauce, just mix a whole fucking stick of butter with cream cheese
this is a recipe in gnome recipes application
torvalds released an update on the release schedule, he updates it once every 2 hours now
logarithmic slows down, exponential gets faster
what do you mean RadiantBastard
you installed gentoo?
as possible as on an rpi
so you left gnome then?
then it's not your desktop
this channel is shit
we have sed commands
port it to qt
port it to qt
there's also the fact that your whole desktop runs on javascript
and you can't change shit
what do you expect from gnome devs
it's not ready but it's very good
wait he was with the OCI
he might be actually I haven't followed him much
yeah he's just another social democrat

it's liberals vs fascists
there are very little commies

both popular parties propose a different way to look at capitalism
show me the two other times
it won't print anything over one line
it's not broken, it just doesn't print anything over one line
no they don't

I've had mine for 6 years and it works fine still
I don't need it to survive a volcano
that doesn't mean macbooks suck though
sure new macbooks, but 2010 to 2014 were nice, powerbooks and ibooks were nice
I like the 2007 model too tbh but that might just be nostalgia
now those are fucking horrible
I mean some ultrabooks are nice
please I'm about to cum stop it
what kind of shitty topic is that
yes but I'm also fine with 21
accelerationism is basically "just let it destroy itself so that we can finally make it better by rebuilding it"
you can't spell it because it's french
even the french can't spell french
trust me I'm french
it's spelled oui oui
also is that cultural appropriation
isn't that just regular capitalism though
with some technocrat goals
also  if that's the extent I feel like it hugely misses the point
the main argument against capitalism these days is that it's not sustainable
that's the most popular one anyway
that claim makes no sense though
how is "communism" not sustainable, and what does it have to do with capitalism
overproduction for overconsumption leading to overwaste
that's capitalism in a nutshell
bad distributions of resources is another point
the accumulation of capital
what is that supposed to be you think
it's the center of capitalism
how do you make capital
you take resources from the earth, transform them into something valuable and sell them
which leads to overproduction
forget communism for a second and listen to me
tell me if I'm wrong on any point
monetization is also the accumulation of capital, to grow the economy
it's what the capitalists strive for
bitch what did I just say
forget communism for a second and listen
we'll talk about the alternatives once you agree with the problem
monetization is the accumulation of capital, yes?
then what is it
what do capitalists want
what do they monetize and for which goal
yes, the goal of monetization is to accumulate capital
so why do the capitalists work?
we're turning in circles here
the point is to get richer
you're just avoiding the fucking term
and what does that company do
it invests that, grows, gets more, grows, accumulates capital to grow more to accumulate more capital
we're turning in circles
I'm not understanding your buzzwords
holy fuck I'm talking about the core concept and now you're talking about investors
why do you want to monetize stuff
if it's not to accumulate
you "innovate" to find new ways to produce capital to accumulate it
because it is, the point is to get more
the point is to grow
the point is to gain property
what does your company do
we're turning in circles again because you're avoiding a fucking word
so that we can't go forward
I don't care about the company that you work for we're entirely theoritical and we're supposed to talk about core concepts
so you don't agree that capitalists, investors, etc. want to gain more property?
so everyone just wants to innovate?
is that what drives them?
yes, because the guy that keeps investing and trying to further his wealth when he's at 100k really wants security
100k a year I mean
so you need to keep growing or else you lose everything because somebody else is growing
yes because companies don't strive for expansion
alright we got that
so how do you expand
what's the meaning of expansion
I don't care whether it's good or bad
what's the meaning of it
I don't care you're going on a tangent again
yes, and how do you do that
at the core, how do you do that
what is the one thing that you need to expand?
I'm gonna build google in a week?
yes, the global market is driven by innovation right?
you just don't want to say it
you expand by acquiring more property, building more lines of production, and selling more to make up for it
is my previous statement wrong?
so you DON'T expand by producing more?
that's just not a thing?
and you DON'T need property to produce more?
what is an investment
what are they investing
yes, what is an asset
to you take your money, you put it in the company, the company has the money
so the company accumulated money
to make more lines of production
where did I go wrong then
no it's about money
you just said so
we're talking about expansion here, we already agree that a company strives for expansion
you don't seem to want to discuss this, you seem to like walking in circles
why do we want the economy to grow
and how does it grow
uh huh because that doesn't follow any logic does it
I do like to turn every protest into free publicity
but why do I like that?
oh, so they aren't trying to expand by turning every protest into free publicity?
and they're selling addictive sugar water because of innovation?
nobody in there wanted to expand about anything
they aren't trying to psychologically manipulate using publicities and addictive substances to expand and never have?
because the droplets of water and the guy drinking it with the brand clearly turned towards the camera convincing you that the taste of Pepsi is more refreshing than free tap water is nothing right?
they're not doing anything?
are you avoiding the point I'm trying to make again?
why do they do all of this?
no, I'm trying to get you to concede that they're trying to expand
because you love turning in circles
what does every company in the market compete for
because their competitors are expanding
sure, because all of those little shops that walmart took over in smaller towns were totally fine by being stable
I'm not talking about objectively what's happening, what drives them
what do they want
they want to survive by competing against their competitors, yeah?
why did they invest
what was the point?
what were they trying to do
we're turning in circles again
will you agree that increasing reach is a form of expansion?
what is it then
what is "securing markets"
hold on I've got a pointless argument to finish
see you said it, gain, to monetize, on your property
now let's go back up
so increasing reach is to secure a gain from specific sources, right?
you know where I'm trying to get at and you're avoiding it
securing a market is a way to have your company grow, right?
so you gain capital, money, from specific sources
that's how you described reaching markets
then you're contradicting yourself too
 securing a market is basically making sure to gain some aspect of the part of the market, you can monetize your product or service
and now you're saying that it's not it?
yes, you're getting property, the next step is to sell it
we're on a tangent again
we're arguing that what the capitalists strive for is growth
HOWEVER THAT MIGHT HAPPEN
so what is advertising
why does pepsi want you to drink their products instead of water
because it's so much more refreshing
that's where advertising comes into play, they manipulate you to get you to drink their product
or else why do people drink pepsi?
it's purely logical isn't it?
you see, you have a noble idea but the real world just isn't that way
people drink pepsi because they're addicted to it, because they were convinced to drink it
because they made it a habit
let's take smoking then
why do tobacco companies sell tobacco and why were they advertising it
why did every public figure in the early 20th century smoke a cigarette in front of the camera
why did they advertise it, why did we need a campaign to stop smoking, why did we need to ban advertising of cigarettes
what I'm trying to say here is that sometimes they might create markets using advertising to create needs
and the purpose of that is purely for growth
so then can you still argue that growth is not a driving factor in capitalism?
that was our initial argument
what is it then
why did they think "well if I convince them to drink my piss I could get rich!"
I don't know ask him apparently we're driven by innovation and growth and accumulation of capital has nothing to do with capitalism
I guess I got it entirely wrong all this time
just the fact that we had this big of an argument for something that's so often conceded means it'd be absolutely impossible to get back to the main point anyway
anyway back on something that's less pointless Caelum
how do they mean "going further than its value system, etc."?
and what gains are they referring to moreover
what's your graphics card
I like the KDE spin's plasma theme
it's a bit more transparent and it looks nice
did you try it or are you on gnome?
what do you mean we lost the war?
I don't like the colour scheme but the actual plasma theme is nice
show me what you mean
you don't like this menu option?
there is no way that I know of, but it would be easy to patch out
hold on maybe I'll find something
if you can disable it, it's in the services tab of your preferences
I'll arrange it for you, it SHOULD be in that menu, so I'll either add it or I'll get the kde team to add it
what version are you on exactly
so you just want it to not show if there are no devices?
I'll try to arrange that
np it might take some time though
KDE versions follow the qt versions
but they have LTS releases now
which makes it less of an issue than the switch from 4 to 5
because they'll keep supporting plasma 5 while 6 is in development
so the shitshow that was plasma 5.0 to 5.4 will be avoidable on plasma 6
next time qt changes version it will be for wayland probably
why would you want to use gtk and why do you want an IDE on linux
I don't know about that, sorry :/
I only know that libinput is not supported
it works, but it's not supported
I don't know, sorry
I don't use gtk applications
you mean make windows move using the keyboard?
not as far as I know, weeb has tried it
it's definitely possible, just nobody bothered to make it
and I don't know enough about qml scripts to make it myself
that's not the same iirc
menu doesn't look like a word anymore :(
menu menu menu menu menu
I just meant that I read menu so many times that it doesn't look like a word anymore
because it's repeated so much
so they're making the switch to clang?
the code is not important to the picture though
it's because of the way they handle that entry
that specific feature probably wasn't updated since kde 4
it looks pretty old
it's probably not even related to dolphin
I can't find it anyway
maybe dolphin scans for another thing that provides this feature
when you hover over the Link to Device option, is it empty?
the feature should either be updated or remove
I mentioned it to #kde-devel, we'll see if they care, otherwise I'll look into it myself
yeah, you could populate it
if that's your issue
but it still shouldn't show up when it's empty
more importantly, I found out that it's part of kio
because that desktop environment has absolutely no features
it's a glorified window manager that breaks integration and pushes CSDs down everybody else's throats
you can disable animations and change compositor backend
that should make it faster
are you on a laptop?
I did the resize things
I'm going to get cwm how I want it then I'll try to use freebsd more, hopefully the drm port won't segfault as much as on plasma/egl
I added a few things, I'm very tempted of just wrecking gmake compatibility though
I'm maintaining my own fork
of the linux port
well it's not really a linux port, just the openbsd code taken to make it crossplatform
that code's really nice to work with though
only issue I've found was this https://github.com/weabot/cwm/blob/master/calmwm.h#L80
and I guess it wasn't made to be extended
otherwise cwm is very easy to extend though
they're not dropping OSS though right?
eh I use alsa on linux just because there are no good alternatives
linux sucks at sounds
KMix is enough to make alsa bearable though
yeah but I haven't gotten it to work on linux
I've tried a few times on both gen(fun)too and void
eh, if we're into that kind of shit we can't expect technology to save us
only if we're in a hacker's war, otherwise the best thing to do in times of crisis is to hole up in a commune and defend it until you become strong
like the spanish did
you need internet access and hardware for tor and cryptocurrencies, and that's easy to sabotage
when the providers are with the government
I think so too
cryptocurrencies still keep the flaws of currency in the first place
and the amount of power that it takes
those bitcoin mines are entirely running on cheap coal electricityu
how can you fu cking back this up
if missiles come into your hands they were either given from somebody who benefits from you beating up your government or you've taken them from someone else
not really, I don't know what your point is
if that's what you're asking
but I don't see much future in tor and bitcoins, especially for revolutionary movements
if we're united through tor that makes us weak and easy as fuck to divide
also if we're united through the internet and we get out of hand, it's very easy for them to shut them down
it's easy to forget that the internet is an actual physical network, not just a bunch of clouds
xi jinping's relatively nice
anything else from 2bwm that I should do that doesn't involve fucking with xinerama?
like north south east west?
I mean the half the screen and centered would be easy to do
otherwise most of this I'd have to fuck with xinerama
and this one I just don't understand
move to the left/right/bottom/top while maxvert/maxhor and half max horizontal/vertical
what the fuck does this even mean
so you mean if I move window to top, set horizontal to max value?
ooh that makes sense
so you want them to take 2 cells
doesn't that manual tiling that I patched in do that already though
or is it in a 3x3?
people still play tf2?
also there's this person called powergrrl or something
earlier you needed a reaction right
say no more https://u.teknik.io/ROaDe.jpg
I got my new microSD
I'm installing openbsd tomorrow
make a buildserver and install gentoo
-layout us,us -variant ,colemak -option grp:alt_shift_toggle
isn't that how gnome does it
kde lets you map it however you want
lumina is basically lxqt-nolenny
because the dev is cute
he loves his icons weeb
how can you not love him
I'm liking my trackball more and more
will be a peak
where I jizz everytime I touch my trackball
and it's all downhill from there
and after that I'll just use apple trackpads on openbsd on my cwm fork where I don't even have to use a mouse anymore
and I'll have ported cwm to wayland by then
I was thinking of that
I think I might use parts of it but not sway itself
I mean openbsd will need a wm for their compositor once they fork/implement wayland
why not just exclusively use your iGPU
radeonsi supports wayland <3
seriously, your thinkpad uses optimus and you claim that it's good?
I wouldn't have that kind of trouble on my macbook
why are you using samsung
I don't play games on my laptop
except for FTL sometimes
what's wrong with /usr/bin
what do you m ean working around it
>reverse engineer through menus
>the code is available online
I learned so much about KDE config just by looking at the code though
like a bunch of shit that I never knew existed
I mean do you really want to configure the whole kde application suite through text files?
the devs either, why would they write documentation for that
but would you REALLY want to configure the fucking kde application suite using text configs
and who the fuck wants to write documentation for that
then do it, nothing stops you
spend fucking hours tracking down every configuration setting and document it
but I'd rather dev time not being spent on that shit
if it's only being used by snowflakes like you, I'd rather not waste the time it'd make to make the documentation
nobody wants to do that, and if that option was there you wouldn't even do that
stop memeposting, you know you wouldn't go through the trouble of finding the right setting in the documentation and finding the right config file to put it in when there's just a checkbox there, and the dev time required to build the documentation that everybody would avoid isn't worth it
it's really easy to say
but with a suite as big as KDE with a full-featured interface that doesn't hide shit from you like, say, gnome does
it's unnecessary and a huge waste of time
if the documentation were there you'd avoid it
if you're not memeposting you're outright stupid
documentation is there for development
there is no reason to document th config files that the full-featured UI, again, uses
I do agree that KDE lacks documentation on some aspects, this isn't one
it's generated and edited by a binary, and still, do you know how fucking long that would take?
for something that nobody even wants to look at, not even you because you don't even use kde software in the first place?
no, because the documentation options are the GUI functions, to be used by their applications
they aren't meant for anything else because any reasonable human being would just find that checkbox in a second and click on it
it's a different design, not a poor design, because it's made to be used by sane people who don't complicate their life for no reason and don't ask either to do so too
then you could configure them once via the UI, which DOESN'T HIDE ANYTHING FROM YOU and keep these configs
you seem to mistaken KDE for GNOME
I understand you, the beeps traumatized me
but KDE is not GNOME
we are free from senseless beeping here
only kde apps right?
for every single one of these applications
find out exactly what it does
and then document it in an understandable manner
that's at least 5 minutes by setting if you're fast
for at least 10 settings by application
for that many applications
no wasted time at all right?
what do you classify as relevant?
a lot of them are
you want me to count them?
kopete ships by default on some DEs
how is it not relevant
what is the limit
where's the line between relevant and not relevant?
just because YOU don't use it it's not relevant?
you see, that's not a way to think about thinks when you maintain a 20 year old application suite, that has a userbase spanning from 20 years ago to just today
where someone might still be using KDE2 software
I stopped counting at 90
I agree about that though
why do you even need it though, that's the thing
it complicates everyone's life to no reason
not just the average user
even weeb wouldn't open them
yes but the nautilus configs are fucking horrible
they hide things from you
the plasma UI doesn't.
everything that might appear in the text file appears in the GUI as clear as they'd be
and it's much easier to find the right checkbox to check than to look up the right setting in documentation and learning a new syntax from the documentation to configure your file manager
snowflakes like you aren't valuable enough to waste development time on
I'd rather the hours of development time that'd be required to do this to be put into bugfixing, new features or documentation of actually useful stuff
that isn't managed automatically by a perfectly clear GUI
that DOESN'T HIDE ANYTHING FROM YOU
do I need to repeat this again?
as simple as it might be, it's still a lot of time
I don't care about you, development time shouldn't be wasted on snowflakes like you
the world isn't about you, and they simply don't make this for you
maybe, but openbsd's design is done with a different idea in mind
who gives a shit
that's not the point
xmonad is a small haskell window manager
how can you compare anything to this
you're not comparing, you're just bringing up other software that do it but kde doesn't?
you're just.. comparing but not comparing
please stop memeposting it's triggering me
maybe, but they don't and rightfully so
because doing this would be a huge waste of time for no reason at all
what do you mean provide one with all the defaults? just take the damn config file
and what's wrong with that?
if the defaults are static you can keep your config files from only the changed ones?
but what the hell is the point in doing that when you could just take two minutes to click on things instead of looking into the documentation, finding the right setting just by its name and replacing it
the devs don't support your  quirks because they make no sense
because they designed their UI in a sane manner
for the most part
how the fuck do you know what to search for
how do you know the right setting's name
there's no reason to waste dev time and organisation money on that regardless
>you barely waste any time
sure try to do it then
even if the devs did remember exactly every single fucking setting, which they definitely don't I can tell you that for a fact
a lot of them come from kde4, kde3, etc.
they would have to do research on most of them
>look mama I'm special other people should waste time for my quirks it wouldnt even be hard lol but i dont wanna do it :DDD
>btw did i mention i dont use any of the applications that I'm talking about
>but they should flinch to my quirks
you know what's available from the GUI not being fucking retarded
why do you talk about KDE like it's gnoem
stop your everything is bad bullshit
DAMMIT DID I MISS MY CHANCE
I've never listened to bach for more than 2 minutes
and that was to transcribe music by ear in music class
no, I listen to better music
.yt big black he's a whore
> (weabot) [44/79] <weabot> autoconf was a mistake
.q AB49K 364 quotes
.q add AB49K 364 quotes
weeb is tonedeaf and tries to hide it by listening to classical music
and pretending he likes it
we're the same person
you've obviously never taken a music class
people actually don't differenciate between tones for some reason
it's not real tone-deaf
does crux have a buildserver?
I just tried that trick with systemd
where if you press ctrl+alt+del 8 times in 2 seconds it reboots
I wish opensuse wasn't such a pain in the ass with a custom kernel
idk what to turn to now
sounds like needless trouble
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.9.2 on Funtoo Linux 2017-02-26 powered by Linux 4.10.12, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4100 MHz, RAM: 2470/7987 MB, Storage: 0/0 GB, 631 procs, 0.04h up
drm port isn't stable yet on freebsd
I'm actively following it
that's the dream :(
segfaults after an hour because of a vram leak
my windows 10 partition is unreadable even though I have ntfs built-in
nvm it was permissions bullshit
opensuse assumes that you're using their kernel and heavily uses its features, that's the issue
haven't had this kind of issue on fedora or ubuntu
so was Steve Jobs
lol crux has a working plasma 5 port before void
spidermonkey's code is such a piece of shit
it builds with hundreds of warnings and for every update of either spidermonkey, javascript or gcc a bunch of them turn into errors
and because of this you need all of these patches
doing well, I'm looking into crux
they have plasma 5 packaged too
I'm not on it yet, it's interesting though
they have a ports-like package manager, but instead of building it on shell scripts or makefiles or a mix of both or python like gentoo does most of it is in C++
if rust fixes this kind of shit I'm in
so shitty code monkeys can make decent code more easily
alright I'm sick of crux
it's a nice project but if I wanted to fix shitty ports I'd use void
where is the "the economy as we know it should not even exist" button?
I mean I'm taking the test honestly
My political ideology should be spread by force if necessary.
what depends what you mean by spread though
I answered my own question I guess
that's why I answered my own question
sometimes you just need to say things out loud
the questions seem to be made by left-leaning college liberals in a way that you can agree with
A strongly hierarchical state is most efficient.
what do they even mean by that?
the political compass is better imo
these questions aren't very good
a lot of these questions depend on the context though
like are they asking about my ideals or about in today's context? because some questions seem to be one some the other
The stronger the leadership, the better.
I mean if there is to be a state I agree, but I think politics should be localized and voted by direct democracy
don't worry Zowlyfon, you don't have to try to please me <3
just don't get hitler-mode
politics aren't meant to be practical, they're meant to establish policies
and which policies should be established depends on the environment in which they are to be established
and the people that live there
that's why I said localized, I want towns to have full control over their policies and I don't want the federal state to have any say or any form of national police
disctricts for major cities
Same-sex marriage should be legal.
bitch I just said that religion has no place in the state and now you're talking about the legal state of marriage
which is/should be purely religious
Communism isn't as bad as people say it is.
what the fuck is that question
All people, cultures, worldviews, genders, sexualities, and economic classes should be treated equally.
THOSE ARE ALL ENTIRELY DIFFERENT ISSUES
huehue another libertatian socialist
and I'm guessing the wealth and tradition parts are because they assumed that I was in favour of the alternative or because of a context that I didn't know about
because the quiz is shit
so apparently trotsky wasd a pacifist liberal
that's why only policies should be done on a localized scale, and everything else on a global scale
I also think defence should be done via stateless unions
on the bdsm quiz
so far I'm answering red or orange to most questions
the one you linked
if there's a result that's around "what the fuck are you even doing on this quiz" I'll probably get it
ur fuckde up
I am judging your sexual needs, be ashamed and humiliated
is that how it works?
I'm just a vanilla faggot
I would like to get into a bisexual couple though
with a girl and a guy
or just  get with a guy or a girl and fuck the opposite gender with them
that's the extent of my kinks
I especially don't like a relationship to be built around sex
it should just come with it
>I especially don't like
what the fuck does that sound like to you other than an opinion or a personal thing
yeah but I mean some of these questions are like 24/7 submissive and live as house pets and shit
also pb those are called fuck buddies
what else is it then?
if they don't have feelings for each other and just stay together to fuck they're fuck buddies
no matter how long they're doing it
then they're fuck buddies turning into an actual couple? or fuck buddies pretending to be in a relationship
in that case they're just fuck buddies living together
are there strings attached? what kind of strings are attached?
so they fuck and they don't care about each other but they're angry if the other fucks another person?
why are they angry?
they don't care about the other person do they?
don't you think at some point if they're so protective of their fuck buddy they'd have an actual emotional attachment, so they'd actually be in a relationship?
if they can endure each other for long enough to get into a monotonic sex life, that's still better than many couples
I'd argue that's just fuck buddies who grew a real relationship together
if they care about the other person enough to be jealous if they fuck someone else and enough to get into a monotonous sex life together they love each other to at least a small extent
they just didn't start romantically and might be more laid back than traditional couples
you know what launches?
so it also works natively on wayland
we settled that already AsmMaster
you should play dota 2 instead
just pick meepo every game
steam is still on xwayland
I haven't played in so long
I used to be 2.8k, then I went on a landslide and quit about 2 years ago, and this summer I got back into it and got up to 2.1k, then went on a landslide and fell down to like 1.5k
yep, solo mmr is 1558
thankfully this is the lowest I've been
I joined dota 2 in the beta
have fun learning russian
not the best to learn
just how good are you in league AsmMaster
that doesn't tell me anything but I'm guessing it's pretty good
I think windranger would be a good semi-support that you could learn with
it has a skillshot so you'll feel right at home
you shouldn't learn with a carry generally
gives you bad habits and a bad approach to the game
what distro are you  on
not really, it just shows you that items give you passive buffs
with supports/spell casters you understand that laning will give you more levels, that active use items are very useful, etc.
you also learn skilling, optimize farm since you don't often have a chance
and you learn support-related mechanics
because you'll have to ward and stack sometimes
yes, dota 2 has a huge learning curve
that's the part beginners have to learn
it's also the part that distinguishes a good player from a bad player
anyone can right click creeps on sniper, but doing it while having a good understanding of the game is what will win you games
dota is much more in depth strategy-wise
otherwise they're similar in objectives and more general strategies
like ganking and shit
yeah on ubuntu you just have to do apt-get install steam
a lot of them are
most AAA games suck though
I heard LoL is pretty bad so I don't think so
but there is salt
you're in 1.1k though
you have to expect that in the trench
the further you go the less salt you'll find
that's why I said until you're pro
at about 3K there's the least salt
then it goes from 1 to 100 real quick in the 4-5k
not enough of that to be a huge issue
as much as actual salt
I don't even remember how many operating systems I have, and I probably have a few remnants on the empty space of one of my drives
so in short, yes
because you're in the wrong community
the GNU and java/web communities are full of SJWs because java/web is populated by college students and GNU is ideological as fuck and stallman's a liberal
MY LIFE FOR AIUR
he's an opensuse dev and a linux personality I guess
listen to the whole thing
he's not, it's just a show
usually the first half points out flaws about l inux and the second half points out the good parts
it's the best binary distro imo
the only issue I have with it is that I can't use my own kernel on it :(
do you want rolling or stable
ubuntu-style releases or a more stable arch/gentoo/void/etc.?
do you like kde
opensuse's kde is fucking great
yeah but you usually don't need to do it
I really miss opensuse though
I'm almost considering leaving my kernel behind
but I'd like to stay on zfs and I  have patches and configs that would be a pain in the ass to maintain on opensuse using modules
usually linux users use chromium
also remind me tomorrow we could play together
firefox is worse in some ways though
no alsa support anymore, gtk3 bullshit, it takes as much ram as chrome now, the GUI looks like trash
you have to build nightly yourself on linux though don't you
it's as gtk+ as steam is
pulseaudio is just a frontend to als
who gives a fuck
most people only use ublock anyway
sure go find the botnet
my point is that chromium isn't botnetted
your point is that it is
HAHAHAHAHA OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE ISN'T BOTNETTED?! XDXDXDXDXD
I am actually, I'm using qtwebengine which is an ungoogled implementation of chromium that can be used inside qt interfaces so that I don't have to bear gtk's CSD ridden bullshit or chromium's shitty limited config
while having chromium's performance
you can use it in qupzilla, qutebrowser and konqueror so far, as a browser
with this there is no reason in the world to ever use firefox
yes, they use chromium as a backend in some way
nope, as of 0.10 if you have qtwebengine installed they'll use it by default
do you have qtwebengine?
it can use both, if it detects qtwebengine it'll use it by default
you don't have qtwebengine
so of course you're on webkit
it's made in python
it doesn't have anything built in
QtWebKit (old or reloaded/NG) or QtWebEngine
what is the new thing
might be a dependency or kernel issue?
what are you on
thought it was just an application but huh
otherwise nothing changed? architecture and shit
how does it not work
I tried crux, I like it but packages are broken and I don't want the bother of a source-based distro with broken packages :(
so I'll try to make myself comfy on void again
if crux has a buildserver it'd be nice, and I like the package management system
I especially like the fact that it's a ports-like package management system that doesn't rely on shitty shell/makefile/python scripts
most important stuff is binary
I wish I could bear redhat heaven :(
you should make a nick that shows your devotion to lenny
# xbps-install qutebrowser qt5-webengine
the PTSD is setting in
isn't spez that one admin who was removing comments
don't worry, he has no power here
our admin was worse
I don't want to ping him :(
the snoonet admin
idk I've never used any other snoonet channels
I mean I have but I'm not active in any of them
except for #apple but it's not active either
if I get comfy I'll use this as my main distro and I'll install opensuse for steam and shit
since steam sucks on void
otherwise I'll probably just make a decent qtwebengine rpm package for fedora 25 myself and I'll install the kde spin
last time I tried it it didn't work
I'm having nice conversation in #tea
do you mean the libraries?
I know about that yeah
yeah it looks nice
where do you click
I think I'd like it, but it's not very big and the ball doesn't have much playing potential
the design looks nice though
yes, being able to play with the ball is one of my criterias
it always rolls off the table and I lose it
no I mean physically play with the ball
the elecom is actually not too expensive huh
I might buy it if I ever want to play video games with a trackball
for now I'm good
what kind of ball
but it looks awkward
I have kensington expert
I was disappointed at first but now I love it
it's still a bit hard to click moving things though
like to actually follow them
it takes some getting used to
my only complaint besides the accuracy whcih is probably just habit is that the buttons are loud as fuck
>having to unscrew shit to take the ball out
how are you supposed to play with it
I told you it's one of my criterias now
I'm playing with it right now while typing
maybe you could try something else based on xen
but usually when I have an issue and can't figure it out I just relax and have a nice night of sleep before getting back to it, then I resolve it quickly with a clear mind
then you're the issue
seriously though unixbird, just relax a bit and go back to it later, that's usually the best thing to do when you can't resolve simple issues
do you meditate?
I have to wake up early on fridays, so I get back home and I'm really tired, so I nap
sometimes it can take me an hour to fall asleep but I don't get up before I'm asleep, I realised last time I napped that that hour is basically an hour of meditation
you can meditate in any position though
it's a mind thing
but I've been doing it without even realising it
which I think is nice
hi justsomeguy do you meditate
I don't think it's something that you can understand until you do it
it's more like a feeling than anything else
it's not enlightened or deep or anything
enlightenment is the worst meme in historyu
what was it
thank you for doing /s
what's wrong though
I mean what's the actual issue
can you chroot into it?
look at the panic, maybe it's the proxmox release that's fucked, etc.
plug it in serial port or something
it will let you see the whole panic
I think you should sleep on it though
I haven't drank strong alcohol in over 2 months <3
and I'd have to spend a lot of money or drink the worst piss to get drunk on beer or wine
idk I've never had to analyse a linux panic
linux panics are usually "lel you didnt give the right root partition"
as far as mine go
void would be very good if the whole thing didn't depend on bash and coreutils
but that's every linux distro except alpine
anyway time for first boot
‎[22:47] ‎[D-Bus]‎ Error: Could not execute script "sysinfo". Check file permissions.
I don't even have it started
don't joke about sudoku it's a serious problem
I'm on lumina
but the dev's cute
is the cwm dev cute?
no I'm rebuilding konversation
that would be nice
a qt scheme?
Id like you to make a qt5 scheme tho
dark grey and dark blue/purple
green/brown would be nice too
just make it dark
alright I fixed konversation
hopefully it won't crash this time
it's late as fuck but i'm trying to port qt5ct to void
yeah it's nice
maybe try a darker green?
i've been  having tight hips lately
probably a side effect of being sedentary :(
i'm losing a lot of weight though
i guess that's good if i ever want to get into gymnastics or something
i really only want to configure my colour scheme on lumina
alright this should work
then i'm going to sleep
well I did it
what's your graphics card
did you make that colour scheme
here i go trying to fix webengine again
there's a work in progress to split the qt5 packages so it'll be easier
I'm using that branch
redhat doesn't have it
I don't have the money
i dont want to work for the NSA
I can never remember where the damn desktop files are
apparently xbps-src fetch means build the whole of qt5
qutebrowser's keybinds are so shit
x doesn't fucking work?
why do I have to press i twice to get into the damn textbox
what do they mean by proper security support
void's kernel is hardened
who said that weeb
I'll send him a pm
I need an emoji
give me an emoji
did i do good
i didnt even look at his post
I can't find the fucking flash plugin
I don't have proper html5 at least I can get flash to make up for it
until I have qtwebengine compiled properly
and qtwebengine is chromium
he's trying to argue that firefox has better html5 support than chromium
he obviously doesn't know what he's talking about
should've just gone the arch way(tm) and thrown all of kf5 in there
does it print helloworld while baking or..
yeah I saw that
there are in some federations if I'm not wrong
idk I might be mixing this with another powerlifting cheat
haven't looked into it for a while
I don't care enough about competitive powerlifting to care about this kind of thing, but it is stupid
I actually dreamed that I was working out last night
it's been at least 2 months
I really should get back into it
I'm waiting to actually crave it so that I really get into it when I get back
and so far it looks like it's heading that way
that's not wrong :/
because it's expensive as fuck?
and it doesn't serve a bigger purpose than most dumbbells?
isn't the point of dumbbells to have something smaller?
at that point why not just use a kettlebell or something
it'd be less awkward
that's what happens when you've got no population and a lot of natural resource to exploit
we export a lot of aluminium
idk about asbestos though

oh no I'm on my laptop and the screen shut
so it logged me off
I'm trying to setup opensuse with zfs and my kernel
but my main setup is funtoo
it's not very well maintained which is why I'm setting up opensuse
never as a main distro
it's an interesting concept but it's not well maintained either
not for every one of them
I am probably using it on opensuse, I just haven't paid attention to it yet
I'm trying to get dracut to work with zfs, I have no idea why it's not working
I really don't like dracut
I hate that distributions either force me to use things I don't like or don't maintain the things I like properly
this is amazing though
oh shit and zypper sourceinstall installs everything their buildserver uses to build the package and lets me edit the settings
I'm guessing it assumes that you already know the basics of ed from their ed manpage
I honestly would've just referenced the ed manpage to teach the expressions and how to use it
I have everything setup on opensuse how I want it
now I just have to get it to boot on zfs
mm das sum dam good spammin
qupzilla but yeah, I found out how fucking amazing zypper sourceinstall is
it gives you the rpm environment just how the buildserver has it with the rpmbuild script and you can edit shit how you need it
it was the easiest thing in the world, easier than editing a voidlinux template at least
hardest part is going to be to have to deal with dracut and zfs
you could make justJanne happy and use quassel
Running inside KDE Plasma 5.9.4 on openSUSE Tumbleweed powered by Linux 4.10.12, CPU: AMD FX(tm)-6300 Six-Core Processor at 4100 MHz, RAM: 2187/7987 MB, Storage: 87/244 GB, 274 procs, 0.23h up
I have the dracut initramfs built properly but I'm not sure whether it boots zfs because I didn't do it succesfully with funtoo
but I'm not sure if it's a lennartware thing or a zfs thing
it made no root or zfs related error
I'm going to make a test with a very basic opensuse environment to see if it works
basically make a zfs pool, put the important shit in and leave the huge shit out and try to boot it

look at his other videos though
hold on my hdd is very slow from all the r/w
it's doing many reads and writes
I see anime though
I'm not sure why I even copied over /proc
isn't it a kernel thing
and it's fucking huge apparently
is this an unlimited write loop
I just freed 100G
anyway I'm reading this
anime is serious business
also opensuse seem to be working on their installer
I noticed some minor interface changes and it's safe to assume that there will be more
well not minor, they removed whole pages
the fuck is an rx 580
>Uses more power than Nvidia's equivalent GTX 1060 6GB
pcgamer definitely not biased
anyway to answer your question luuuunix yes
you'll need a newer kernel and probably amdgpu-pro
but yes it will be supported
I fucking hate dracut
>a start job is running for NTP Server Daemon, please wait 3 minutes for it to gently finish :)
they don't have a raspberry pi 3 image
I'm going to try to make my initramfs from the zfs one to see if that'll work
maybe that's the issue
arcadius3d[m] ark is alright
maybe I could just go back to btrfs
I mean it's shit compared to zfs but it does the job
I'm on a desktop
I'd only use openbsd on my pi
why does dracut just assume that I have modules ready for it
I had to enable module support in my kernel for it now
I absolutely hate dracut
>hi I need an internal copy of zfs lol what are you expecting from me
>WHY DO YOU HAVE YOUR OWN COPY THIS IS DUPLICATED I CAN'T DO THAT
>lol you don't have a copy? too bad I can't mount shit beside your root partition :DD
there is no winning
I'm trying to get dracut to boot a zfs partition with a kernel that has zfs builtin
bitch the fuck did i just say
no I said dracut is the biggest piece of shit in the unix world
I fucking hate it
any normal fucking initramfs wouldn't have systemd embedded just to setup a fucking filesystem
and by that extent udev
and why does it have to assume that I'm using a generic 100% modular kernel like built-in doesn't exist anymore
I'm letting out about 4 hours of built up frustration
I'm trying to get it to boot a zfs filesystem that's built into my kernel
but dracut just assumes that everything's modular
so if I give it the modules that it complains about, it complains that there's already something in my kernel, if I don't, it complains that it can't boot without the modules, if I don't give it the modules and remove every call to them in the source, it complains that it can't mount the rootfs for some stupid reason
it's probably the dracut module's fault though, I'll need to write my own I guess
fear you don't learn linux from books imo
a 14 year old will learn much easier by practise
give her a linux distro and let her have fun
why am I not in bash.org :(
fear you would too if you had to deal with dracut's bullshit as much as I did today
you want a theme or a colour scheme?
not sure then, always stuck with breeze
I'm reading dracut's developer documentation
colour schemes make a surprising difference
you should try a few of them out
I use obsidian coast
now that's what I call useful documentation
a short intro, throw in your useless man pages and it's done
Chapter 11. Developer Manual
you can't make this shit up
not even a //TODO
how's your server doing
is it running now?
wait zinixbot is here
I guess it is
so you have 2 servers now
I'm knee deep in dracut trying to switch to opensuse without giving up my kernel or zfs
I'm learning just how badly I hate dracut
> (weabot) [38/79] <weabot> if I ever want to use emacs seriously I'll read tutorials and shit but I'm fine with vim and vim plugins for shitty developer tools provided by a corrupt corporation that really likes to watch me masturbate
that deserves a kick I think
no it was cake
I really need some sleep
I was starting to see dracut modules as poor children trapped in the dracut dungeon
with udev and systemd as their abusive guards
anyway I need to test this shit again
systemd is such a piece of shit
thought you liked buying gas from russia
we're still on X11
no because it seems to be working
I fucking hate systemd and dracut
let's just overcomplicate shit until the devs that use our stuff are forced to write complete hacks that really only work by default
I'm not even saying this because of the circlejerk
I'm knee deep into it
I've been working for over 10 hours to get systemd/dracut to execute a single command with a single variable
a very big chapter
I'm trying to get dracut to load zfs with the modules built into my kernel
but now the issue is well past that
turns out that opensuse's dracut uses systemd which just blindly bypasses a bunch of dracut functions and scripts for absolutely no reason
and environment variables aren't passed around between each otehr
that's just the US though
shitty infrastructure for shitty service :^)
I'm trying to switch to opensuse
it's going well, I j ust had to work over 10 hours on the dracut module
if I want to use my own kernel yeah
zfs is easy if you're using modules
I just like to avoid those
so that my kernel works the same everywhere
KDE Neon has an LTS release
so it is stable
looking it up right now
they usually stick tightly to their schedule
first subversion is usually not very good but they fix it fast
they add a LOT of things each release though
it's not like gnome and a few less features every release
I think so, they want to make it usable by 5.12
the variables are handled by dracut and the execution is handled by systemd
and they don't contact each other for fuck all
KWin makes X11 bearable
just because it's such a good compositor
I'm out of ideas
I'm gonna make an lmr shitpost
worst case scenario a systemd fanboy fixes my issue to prove a point
what's the best way to pass a variable to a systemd service
no it needs to receive it not to set it
I want to use a variable in the service file to decide what to mount
it's systemd in dracut
the variable comes from a dracut hook script
I need it to get to the systemd service
would the EnvironmentFile work?
I'm pastebinning the relevant files
but I don't know what that pool would be
I don't want to mount multiple pools
I just want the specific pool from the kernel command line to be mounted
well it's set in the parse script already
I could save it to a file in root and get it from that file using this but that feels like a hack
maybe systemd is initialized during that script
I just have to do systemctl set-environment zpool ${zpool} in my parsing script
the parsing script is in a dracut hook, and I need it there for compatibility reasons
I need it to work whether or not the systemd module is in the initramfs
if systemd's in there, systemctl set-environment etc. etc.
alright time to try it
alright it imports the pool
but for some reason systemd doesn't switch-root
so I have to do it manually..........
this is fucking weird
anyway I went from 2 commands to run to 1
I deserve a good break
because I haven't eaten all day
there are absolutely no logs telling me what's wrong
what the hell I think it "failed to mount /sysroot/" before it was mounting /sysroot
I FUCKING DID IT!
and my sound's fixed too

You go , “What the fuck is this shit ?” You are fooled , this is not how we should install an operating system .

hold on fam
you're not on opensuse
opensuse is another freedesktop OS, just better
I actually read it
that's pretty funny actually
I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as GNU/Linux, is in fact, Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, Linux. GNU/Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather a fully functioning operating system plus the GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full GNU as defined by POSIX.
>comprising a full GNU as defined by POSIX
it's just a definition though, it doesn't use it
it automatically installs macports?
but there's /etc/paths on macOS
which is fucking great
I MISSED YOU BRUV

a bomb for every beat
earbuds are only good at being discrete
yeah but don't go for the higher quality ones
like if you sit down and chill somewhere why not just pop out headphones
I really only use earbuds while walking or on the bus or shit
why did dt2 vs dt1 matter anyway
it's just different packaging
so why did you even ask
why arent you on ZFS
>not copy on write
doesn't get in your way
it only uses the memory that you don't use
btrfs uses too much memory
because it's shit on that part
it's as simple as that
>written in emacs lips
apacman written in bash
this is fucking horrible
let's stop talking about arch
probably coming from someone who has never used macOS
at least that shit doesn't force updates
it doesn't even prompt you
after you've turned off the setting initially I mean
you can use ZFS, I agree with the two others
that too but modern laptops have 8 to 16G of ram and it's plenty for macOS
also ZFS doesn't feel like it takes ram, it only utilizes free ram so that's fine I think
kwin makes better rice
what are you on
you can just install kwin and tell your DE to use it
all the other dependencies are because of arch
it also pulls all of kf5
and probably even some kde apps
>you literally can't use anything KDE without wanting the whole KDE desktop
there is no standalone version it's all the same
it just pulls different dependencies
it's all the same code and probably even the same options
>when you're so used to arch dependencies that you don't know what dependencies are anymore
you could just grab the source from download.kde.org, make sure build dependencies are installed and compile it and you'll have your standalone version
all you have to do is tell your DE to use kwin_x11
maybe not, but the dependencies for dependencies is where it'll get you
then the dependencies for dependencies for dependencies
I'll make you a script hold on 5 minutes
it's not gnome
I'm looking at the dependencies on arch, keep in mind they might pull a bunch of shit too
so they split libreoffice by language
but they didn't split qt5 at all
what the hell is this
this should work https://paste.kde.org/pnuilrypz
actually the kwin package pulls a lot of things but nothing that'll bother you I think
installing that seems reasonable
Please, start investing resources into these problems or soon we all will totally go blind.
wait reinstalled arch? why?
install something else instead
even debian or ubuntu would be better though
if you're not going to go for kde why not void
make a buildserver
rsync your /var/tmp/portage directory with it
what do you plan to use
void would be perfect if the fucking maintainers merged plasma already
you could easily port that though
if you rarely update your system why do you want bleeding edge
you could also use opensuse with lxqt, it uses kwin by default too
and tumbleweed is bleeding edge
this guy was saying that all users are fucking stupid today because he got credit card information and addresses from a lady's desktop with physical access to her computer
like unlocked physical access
even if she did, he probably got it from her open google chrome session or something and pretended to purchase something just to get the completion
I mean physical access to the computer is already a security issue, it doesn't prove any point
especially if the session's fucking opened
well I can plant something that gives me previous data from future data can't I
and even that is provided the session's not already fucking opened lol
well yeah that's why you should avoid chrome and you should avoid giving physical access to someone you don't trust
qupzilla can use kwallet

decent city design beats any car
if we invested in public transportation instead of investing billions of dollars in the past century on getting everyone their own polluting scrap of metal on 4 tires sure
public transportation makes more sense the denser you get though
but you're right I'm dreaming of a world where rationality makes the decisions over the market
the montreal metro isn't a particularly good one compared to much of Europe and it takes a lot of people where the hell they want it nearly from door to door, while driving is known to be fucking impossibnle in montreal
it's not just a nightmare
imagine a big european city as you must know it except it's full of potholes because of winter
along with the narrow streets
this is actually what it looks like in spring
quebec city is a good example actually, it's a pretty large city in size but it's not very dense
one company has monopoly on public transportation here and we're getting fucked in the ass by it
I pay 60$ a month for the only bus that I take that only passes once an hour
and that's because of my student discount
the one here is worst of both worlds
it's almost publicly funded but privately owned
so it fucks us in the ass for profit while taking in our tax money
it's a good loss if it means people can get to work safely and efficiently
a good transportation system means that people who might not have the means can take a job on the other side of the city
quebec city is a good middle ground, but the only good transport either go to the tourist area or the mall
and those are the places that I frequent the least
we have about 1000 people per square kilometer

my terminal doesn't even scroll back far enough for me to see half the amount of digits of the number it would return
I could set it to though
I do love me sum flash animations
it's japanese conservative imperialist propaganda
I wouldn't use a computer ever
still x86 machine code isn't much better
I have the biggest data right here if you wanna analyze it ;)
mmm so big data
such a powerful buzzword
isn't it technically just statistical algorithms and shit
that they call big data
it's a good buzzword though
you saved 5 bucks tho
im proud of you
the fuck is a kensington cable
I don't like kensington
they made these clicky buttons louder than thunder
my syrian neighbours think ISIS is bombing canada everytime I click
while my christian neighbour thinks jesus is having a second coming and wants revenge
I mean the syrians would probably think it's the russians
they were picked up by turks so they think it's assad and the russians that were bombing them
people picked up by NATO think it's ISIS, people picked up by the russians and assad think it's NATO, and the people picked up by ISIS know it's ISIS
actually they think it's heretics
stop using brand names
because it's made with pride in california
and you should never forget how disgusting that makes them
it's made in the middle country so I forgive them
systemd is working surprisingly well after I spent a day fixing it
not just politics, it's a huge monolithic piece of shit that tries to be everything but fails at everything
it's too complex for no good reason when it should only be an init system
but in this case it should be much simpler than it is
also there's the fact that they're pushing every application to modify their own code for compliance, and systemd isn't standard and it's not portable to other nixes, so that hurts compatibility with other nixes
as it seems the lenny team are pushing for non-systemd to become pretty much legacy
that isn't the issue
QUICK THEY'RE GONNA GET YOU
I do love the refreshing taste of Pepsi though!
this is not a coincidence
my uefi is so shit
I can't even ender its setup anymore
or 1. buy ryzen 2. buy new motherboard because new CPU 3. be happy 3,1. be disappointed
intel has AMD spyware
instead of only Linux it'll be only NetBSD and redhat that'll work
and redhat will be limited to serverware
but I already have a macbook :DDDD
isn't a soldered SSD a good thing
is it still SATA then?
if the motherboard dies though any laptop would die with it
the issue is if the SSD dies
then I've got a useless hunk of metal soldered to my motherboard taking in power
if it's more compact and its read/write is faster how is it
it's not like being modular is their priority
I can replace ram, battery and HDD on my macbook
idk about the new ones though
but I don't see a soldered SSD as a bad thing
the SSD isn't a cheap model either
I'm gonna keep it till the CPU dies
a soldered SSD isn't an issue imo though
more compact more performant and who the fuck's gonna replace a CPU on a laptop except for crazy people
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk0 bs=4K
you're talking like it's a 20$ SSD
I don't know that and you don't either

>hi, having storage soldered right on the motherboard isn't more performant than going through a connector :DDDD
you can use ZFS
and they're working on a new filesystem with sierra
only if you woke up to 1337 bits uploaded
have you ever even posted something on a social media account that's not yours
1337 enough for me
we are anonymoose we are herd we forget a lot we cannot forgive wait for us
no nobody uses hurd
even stallman doesn't use hurd
just going to be either an american puppet or a russian puppet
the fuck do you expecct
they didn't stay alive in south america
neither did the IWW in the US
the fact that the word spreads might bring back the idea to people that the left isn't just more taxes, but I don't think it'd go beyond that
the YPG is just another leftists army that some empire uses as a puppet while it's convenienty
they had the soviets on their side back then though
now they either have to kneel to NATO or to Russia
ISIS were funded by the US
points don't work here
windows partition are checked automatically by systemd-boot, but you can set up an efi config for it that might override it
apparently it's Bootmgfw.efi that it should start
what do you mean? it just added an option and the windows boot manager one is still there?
yeah that's what I thought
idk if you can disable it
the manpage is fucking useless as with every other freedesktopware
a simple workaround would probably be to rename the Microsoft directory
mv /boot/efi/EFI/Microsoft /boot/efi/EFI/Windows
but if you share your efi partition with windows it'll probably just recreate the Microsoft directory
good then, try that
because systemd-boot autodetects it by expecting it to be at that path
if it isn't there, maybe it won't detect it
oh god please don't remind me of this
no he'll probably just ask to borrow it
not really, they don't do things from inside the elevator
the best person is someone that you like :)
doesn't it usually just have applets
only thing that's missing for my boot setup to be complete is systemd-uefi
seriously though just having a whole linux kernel in my uefi would work better and faster than what I have now
coreboot is not systemd
nor is it uefi actually is it?
come to #bsdmasterrace we have hookers
let the temptation overcome you
so this motherboard supports coreboot but it's 300$
I just want a good uefi
good job, you can set the light and dark colours in the settings
I don't like your memes
I don't like the topic memes
shill for #bsdmasterrace in there instead
#bsdmasterrace: where the mods aren't fascists yet
if you get banned by shilling #bsdmasterrace we'll give you free vop!*
look for one on the side of the road
but your cat would enjoy the cat piss on it
I have a very cheap chair and it's okay
it was something like 80$ CAD
that's like 25 cents USD
